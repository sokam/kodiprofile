00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,040
This programme contains some scenes which some viewers may find upsetting.

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,960
Tell me about your morning.

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,640
Start from the beginning.

4
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,560
I woke up.

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,600
How did you sleep?

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,480
I didn't. I don't.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,080
You just said you woke up.

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,960
I stopped lying down.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,360
Alone?

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,240
Of course alone.

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,080
I meant Rosie. Your daughter.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,160
- Er, she's with friends.
- Why?

13
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,400
Can't always cope.

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,400
And, er, last night wasn't good.

15
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,080
That's understandable.

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,600
Is it? Why? Why is it understandable?

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,120
Why does everything have to be understandable?

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,360
Why can't some things be unacceptable and we just say that?

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,760
I only mean it's OK.

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,120
I'm letting my daughter down, how the hell is that OK?

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,800
You just lost your wife.

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,600
And Rosie just lost her mother.

23
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,080
You are holding yourself to an unreasonable standard.

24
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,280
No, I'm failing to.

25
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,040
So there is no-one you talk to? Confide in?

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,040
No-one.

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,840
Oh, I'm picking up Rosie this afternoon,

28
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,280
after I've seen my therapist.

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,440
Got a new one, seeing her today.

30
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,440
Are you going to tell her about me?

31
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,480
No.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,360
Why not?

33
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,320
- Because I can't.
- Why not?

34
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,840
Because I can't. You know I can't. She thinks you're dead.

35
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,520
John, you've got to remember, it's important.

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,840
I am dead.

37
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,320
Please, for your own sake and for Rosie's, this isn't real.

38
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,960
- I'm dead. John, look at me.
- Hmm.

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,560
I'm not here.

40
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,600
You know that, don't you?

41
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,600
OK, I'll see you later.

42
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,360
Is there anything you're not telling me?

43
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,840
No.

44
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,520
What are you looking at?

45
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,080
Nothing.

46
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,120
You keep glancing to my left.

47
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,400
Oh, I suppose I was just looking away.

48
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,960
There is a difference between looking away and looking to.

49
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,080
- I tend to notice these things.
- I'm sure.

50
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,400
Now, I am reminding you of your friend, I think.

51
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,360
That's not necessarily a good thing.

52
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,720
Do you talk to Sherlock Holmes?

53
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,520
I haven't seen him. No-one's seen him.

54
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,200
He's locked himself away in his flat. God knows what he's up to.

55
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,000
Do you blame him?

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,080
I don't blame... I don't think about him.

57
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,200
- Has he attempted to make contact with you?
- No.

58
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,560
How can you be sure? He might have tried.

59
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,400
No, if Sherlock Holmes wants to get in touch,

60
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,280
that's not something you can fail to notice.

Well, now, won't you introduce me?

66
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,400
- REPORTER:
- Mr Smith, will you say something about your property...

67
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,800
Hello.

68
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,680
Mr Smith? Whenever you are ready.

69
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,320
The charity fund...

70
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,880
Now, please.

71
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,640
Bring them through.

72
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,200
It's difficult, having such good friends.

73
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,520
Friends are people you want to share with.

74
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,080
Friends and family.

75
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,600
What's the very worst thing you can do to your very best friends?

76
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,920
Something on your mind?

77
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,200
Yes, Ivan.

78
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,320
Oh, yes.

79
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,960
Whatever you tell us stays in this room.

80
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,120
I think I speak for everyone.

MURMURS OF ASSENT

82
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,080
Well, what is the worst thing you could do?

83
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,320
Tell them your darkest secret.

84
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,280
Because if you tell them and they decide they'd rather not know,

85
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,400
you can't take it back.

86
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,000
You can't unsay it.

87
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,280
Once you've opened your heart, you can't close it again.

88

CULVERTON ROARS WITH LAUGHTER

89
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm kidding!

90
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,360
Of course you can.

91
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,960
Well, everyone, please roll up your right sleeves.

92
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,120
Roll up your right sleeves. Come on.

93
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,920
Oh, it's, er...

94
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,000
It's a bit of insurance.

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,960
I don't understand. What is that?

96
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,440
TD 12.

97
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,960
One of ours.

98
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,000
One of yours?

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,840
We make it. My company, TD 12.

100
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,720
Sells mainly to dentists and hospitals,

101
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,680
for minor surgical procedures.

102
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,880
Interferes with...

103
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,600
..with the memory.

104
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,640
The memory. Yes.

105
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,360
I want to thank you, Ivan, for allowing me to use it.

106
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,840
I didn't exactly know who you were going to be using it on.

107
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,000
You mean you didn't ask?

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,600
Is everyone ready?

109
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,920
- No.
- Please, roll up your sleeves. Come on, roll up.

110
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,040
This is obscene.

111
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,800
All I'm doing, Faith, dear...

112
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,240
..is getting something off my chest, without getting it on yours.

113
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,640
What you're about to hear me say may horrify you, but...

114
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,160
..you will forget it.

115
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,440
If you think about it,

116
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,680
civilisation has always depended on a measure of elective ignorance.

117
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,960
HE CHUCKLES

118
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,960
These drip feeds will keep the drug in your bloodstreams

119
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,680
at exactly the right levels.

120
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,480
Nothing that is happening to you now will stay with you

121
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,160
for more than a few minutes.

122
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,960
I'm afraid that some of the memories you've had up to this point

123
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,920
might also be...

124
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,360
..corrupted.

125
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,160
I'm going to share something with you now,

126
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,120
something personal and of importance to me.

127
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:31,040
I have a need to confess, but you, I think, might have a need to forget.

128
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,800
By the end of this, you'll be free to go, and don't worry,

129
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,000
by the time you're back in the outside world,

130
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,680
you will not remember any of what you've heard.

131
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,080
Ignorance is bliss.

132
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,960
Well, what's wrong with bliss?

133
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,200
DISTORTED TONE

134
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,240
Some of you know each other and some of you don't.

135
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,000
Please, be aware that one of you is a high-ranking police officer.

136
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,400
One of you is a member of the judiciary.

137
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,080
One of you sits on the board of a prominent broadcaster.

138
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,880
Two of you work for me.

139
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,240
And one of you, of course, is my lovely daughter, Faith.

140
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,720
You are the people I need to hear me.

141
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,160
I have made millions.

142
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,680
For myself, for the people round this table,

143
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,000
for millions of people I've never even met.

144

REPORTERS CLAMOUR

145
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,440
There are charities that I support who wouldn't exist without me.

146
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,040
If life is a balance sheet, and I think it is,

147
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,520
why, I believe I'm in credit!

148
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,000
But I have a situation that needs to be...managed.

149
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,280
I have a problem and there is only one way that I can solve it.

150
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,280
And what's that?

151
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,200
I'm terribly sorry.

152
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,400
I need to kill someone.

153
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,320
Who?

154
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,480
Were we in a meeting? Was there a meeting?

155
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,800
Need to kill someone.

156
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,880
Faith...

157
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,560
- My dear, dear girl.
- I can't remember.

158
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,360
Can't remember who you were going to kill.

159
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,080
Dear, in five minutes, you won't even remember why you were crying.

160
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,240
The others are all fine.

161
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,560
You know they've gone down the pub.

162
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,040
It's all on me!

163
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,520
FAITH CRIES

164
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,600
Oh, Faith, don't you think I should take that?

165
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,480
It's only going to upset you. Hmm?

166
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,920
Three years ago, my father told me he wanted to kill someone.

167
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,720
One word, Mr Holmes, and it changed my world forever.

168
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,200
Just one word.

169
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,840
What word?

170
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,960
A name.

171
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,600
What name?

172
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,960
I can't remember.

173
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,240
I can't remember who my father wanted to kill.

174
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,720
- And I don't know if he ever did it.
- Well, you've changed,

175
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,640
you no longer top up your tan and your roots are showing.

176
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,120
Letting yourself go?

177
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,160
Do you ever look in the mirror and want to see someone else?

178
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,680
- No, do you own an American car?
- I'm sorry?

179
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,840
No, not American, left-hand drive, that's what I mean.

180
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,520
No. Why do you ask?

181
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,320
Not sure, actually, probably just noticed something.

182
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,280
Are you OK?

183
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,800
Oh, of course you don't own a car, you don't need one, do you,

184
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,120
living in isolation, no human contact, no visitors.

185
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,840
- OK, how do you know that?
- Well, it's all here, isn't it? Look.

186
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,600
Cost-cutting is clearly a priority for you,

187
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,360
look at the size of your kitchen, teeny tiny.

188
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,360
Must be a bit annoying when you're such a keen cook.

189
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,960
- I don't understand...
- Hang on a minute,

190
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,000
I was looking out of the window, why was I doing that?

191
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,920
- I don't know.
- Me neither. Must have had a reason.

192
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,280
It'll come back to me.

193
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,120
Presumably you downsized when you... when you left your job

194
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,800
and maybe when you ended your relationship.

195
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,880
- You can't know that.
- Course I can.

196
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,440
There wasn't anything physical going on, was there?

197
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,120
For quite some time, in fact.

198
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,360
There, see? It's obvious.

199
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,640
You can't tell things like that from a piece of paper.

200
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,200
I think I just did, didn't I?

201
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,520
I'm sure that was me.

202
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,680
How?

203
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,040
Don't know. Just sort of happens really.

204
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,280
It's like a reflex, I can't stop it.

205
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,360
Coat.

206
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,840
I don't have a coat.

207
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,080
Yes, what I just noticed. I wonder why.

208
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,600
Who are you talking to?

209
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,840
Piss off!

210
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,400
So what do you think?

211
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,160
- Of what?
- My case.

212
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,600
Oh, it's way too weird for me. Go to the police,

213
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,840
they're really excellent at dealing with this complicated sort of stuff.

214
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,520
Tell them I sent you - that ought to get a reaction. Night-night.

215
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,680
SLOWED-DOWN WHOOSH

216
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,600
Please... I have no-one else to turn to.

217
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,560
Yes, well, I'm very busy at the moment,

218
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,000
I have to drink a cup of tea.

219
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,000
Is "cup of tea"...code?

220
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,080
It's a cup of tea.

221
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,680
Because you might prefer some "coffee".

222
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,960
You're my last hope.

223
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,240
Really? That's bad luck, isn't it? Goodnight, go away.

224
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,000
What's bad luck?

225
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,240
Stop talking, it makes me aware of your existence.

226
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,160
I've always had bad luck. It's congenital.

227
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,280
Handbag!

228
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,760
That's not rude. Congenital. It just means...

229
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,080
Handbag!

230
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,360
Stop! Wait! Your life is not your own!

231
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,840
Keep your hands off it, do you hear me?

232
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,560
Off it. Off it.

233
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,240
Sorry? What? What are you talking about?

234
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,320
- Your skirt.
- My skirt?

235
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,040
Look at the hem of it, that's what I noticed.

236
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,080
Sorry, I'm still catching up with my brain. It's terribly fast.

237
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,040
Those markings, you see them?

238
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,560
You only get marks like that by trapping the hem of your skirt

239
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
in a car door, but they're on the left-hand side,

240
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,880
so you weren't driving, you were in the passenger seat.

241
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,080
I came in a taxi.

242
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,960
There is no taxi waiting in the street outside,

243
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,080
that's what I checked when I went to the window.

244
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,600
And you've got all the way to the door

245
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,200
and not made any move to phone for one.

246
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,320
And look at you.

247
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,280
You didn't even bring a coat, in this rain?

248
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,520
Now, all that might mean nothing,

249
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,040
except with the angle of the scars on your left forearm,

250
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,120
you know, under that sleeve you keep pulling down.

251
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,880
You never saw them.

252
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,520
No, I didn't, so thank you for confirming my hypothesis.

253
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,000
I don't really need to check

254
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,760
- that the angle is consistent with self-harm, do I?
- No.

255
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,840
Then you can keep your scars.

256
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,560
I want to see your handbag.

257
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,280
Why?

258
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,960
It's too heavy.

259
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,640
You said I was your last hope and now you are going out into the night

260
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,360
with no plan on how you're getting home...

261
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,080
..and a gun.

262
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,960
- Chips.
- Chips?

263
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,960
You're suicidal, you're allowed chips.

264
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,960
Trust me, it's about the only perk.

265
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,720
Sherlock? Are you going out?

266
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,920
I think I remember the way, it's through there, isn't it?

267
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,240
But you're in no state, look at you!

268
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,120
Yeah, well, I've got a friend with me, so...

269
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,760
What friend?

270
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,800
Bye.

271
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,880
Oh!

272
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,840
Come on.

273
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm Culverton Smith, and this election year, I'll be voting...

274
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,040
For God's sake! I was talking to the Prime Minister.

275
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,480
I'm sorry, Mr Holmes, it's your brother. He's left his flat.

276
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,200
Was it on fire?

277
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,280
SIZZLING

278
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,160
'Even when I'm on the road, I still like quality food.'

279
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,000
You see the fold in the middle?

280
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,560
For the first few months you kept this hidden, folded inside a book.

281
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,560
It must have been a tightly packed shelf,

282
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,400
going by the severity of the crease.

283
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,520
So obviously you were keeping it hidden

284
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,920
from someone living in the same house at a level of intimacy

285
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,320
where privacy could not be assumed. Conclusion - relationship.

286
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,960
Not any more, though.

287
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,040
There's a pinprick at the top of the paper.

288
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,920
For the past few months it's been on open display on a wall.

289
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,040
Conclusion? Relationship is over.

290
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,840
The paper's been exposed to steam in a variety of cooking smells,

291
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,760
so it must have been on display in the kitchen.

292
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,320
A lot of different spices, you're suicidal,

293
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,560
alone and strapped for cash, yet you're still cooking to impress.

294
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,240
You're keen, then.

295
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,480
The kitchen is the most public room in any house.

296
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,120
And since any visitor could be expected to ask about

297
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,080
a note like this, I have to assume you don't have any.

298
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,680
You've isolated yourself.

299
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,600
Amazing.

300
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,640
I know.

301
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,320
I meant the chips.

302
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,320
Hmm.

303
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,640
HELICOPTER WHIRS

304
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,480
Let's go for a walk.

305
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,560
PHONE BUZZES

306
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,280
- You should answer it.
- It's Mycroft.
- Might be about Sherlock.

307
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,880
Of course it's about Sherlock. Everything's about Sherlock.

308
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,480
'How did you know my kitchen was tiny?'

309
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,000
Well, look, the fading pattern on the paper, it's not much,

310
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,280
but it's enough to know your kitchen window faces east.

311
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,600
Now, kitchen noticeboards.

312
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,680
By instinct, you place them at eye level, where there's natural light.

313
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,520
Now look, the sun's only struck the bottom two thirds,

314
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,120
but the line is straight,

315
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,760
so that means we know the paper is facing the window.

316
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,800
But, because the top section is unaffected,

317
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,800
we know the sunlight can only be entering the room at a steep angle.

318
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,320
If the sunlight was able to penetrate the room

319
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,040
when the sun was lower in the sky,

320
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,960
then the paper would be equally faded, top to bottom.

321
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,320
But no - it only makes it when the sun is at its zenith,

322
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,680
so I'm betting that you live in a narrow street on the ground floor.

323
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,240
Now, if steeply angled sunlight manages to hit eye level

324
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,200
on the wall opposite the window, then what do we know about the room?

325
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,120
The room's small.

326
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,040
HELICOPTER WHIRS

327
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,800
Oh, Big Brother is watching you!

328
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,840
Literally.

329
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,200
We can keep tabs. You didn't have to come in.

330
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,760
I was talking to the Prime Minister.

331
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,680
Oh, I see.

332
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,600
What's he doing?

333
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,960
Why is he just wandering about like a fool?

334
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,520
She died, Mycroft. He's probably still in shock.

335
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,120
Everybody dies.

336
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,200
It's the one thing human beings can be relied upon to do.

337
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,400
How can it still come as a surprise to people?

338
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,600
You sound cross.

339
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Am I going to be taken away by security again?

340
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,680
I have, I think, apologised extensively.

341
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,280
You haven't made it up to me.

342
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,960
And how am I supposed to do that?

343
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,480
- Sex.
- I'm sorry?

344
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,320
Sex. How did you know I wasn't getting any?

345
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,400
It's all about the blood.

346
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,200
This one comes from the very first night.

347
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,000
You can see the pen marks over it.

348
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,640
I think you discovered that pain stimulated your memory,

349
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,320
so you tried it again later.

350
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,600
I'm no expert, but I assume that since your lover failed to notice

351
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,080
an increasing number of scars over a period of months,

352
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,640
that the relationship was no longer intimate.

353
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,240
How do you know he didn't notice?

354
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,360
- Oh, well, cos he would have done something about it.
- Would he?

355
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,600
Wouldn't he? Isn't that what you people do?

356
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,800
- Well, that's interesting.
- What is?

357
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,520
- The way you think.
- Superbly?
- Sweetly.

358
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,680
I'm not sweet, I'm just high. This way.

359
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,680
- Well, we just came that way.
- I know, it's a plan.

360
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,840
What plan?

361
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,600
What is it? What... What now?

362
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,240
Sorry, um, traced his route on the map.

363
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,520
HE SIGHS

364
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,480
Is he with someone?

365
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,720
Not sure. We keep losing visual.

366
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,680
Mostly we're tracking his phone.

367
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,600
Don't call us, we'll call...

368
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,920
I'm trying to sleep, can you stop ringing my damn phone?

369
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,640
'Sherlock has left his flat, first time in a week.'

370
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,360
- So I'm having him tracked.
- 'Nice.'

371
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,920
It's very touching how you can hijack the machinery

372
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,960
of the state to look after your own family.

373
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,560
Can I go to sleep now?

374
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,800
Sherlock gone rogue is a legitimate security concern.

375
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,720
The fact that I'm his brother changes absolutely nothing.

376
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,640
It didn't the last time, and I assure you, it won't with...

377
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,520
..with Sherlock.

378
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,920
Sorry, what?

379
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,320
'Please phone me if he gets in contact, thank you.'

380
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,320
Do you still speak to Sherrinford?

381
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,840
I get regular updates.

382
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,080
And?

383
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,720
Sherrinford is secure.

384
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,280
Are we going to walk all night?

385
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,440
Possibly. It's a long word.

386
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,960
What is?

387
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,440
"Bollocks".

388
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,600
Culverton Smith, all this charity work,

389
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,840
what's in it for you?

390
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,360
We must be careful not to burn our bridges.

391
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,720
Do you know why I'm going to take your case?

392
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,000
Because of the one impossible thing you said.

393
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,800
What impossible thing?

394
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,120
You said your life turned on one word.

395
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,240
Yes. The name of the person my father wanted to kill.

396
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,400
That's the impossible thing. Just that, right there.

397
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,800
What's impossible?

398
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,560
Names are not one word. They're always at least two.

399
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,320
Sherlock Holmes. Faith Smith. Santa Claus. Winston Churchill.

400
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,920
Napoleon Bonaparte... Actually, just Napoleon would do.

401
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,000
Or Elvis.

402
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,720
Well, I think we can rule both of them out as targets.

403
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,320
OK, I got it wrong, then.

404
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,360
It wasn't on one word, it can't have been.

405
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,120
And you remember quite distinctly

406
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,200
that your whole life turned on one word.

407
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,240
So that happened, I don't doubt it, but how can that word be a name?

408
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,640
A name you instantly recognised that tore your world apart?

409
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,280
- OK, well, how?
- No idea...yet.

410
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,640
But I don't work for free.

411
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,240
- You take cash?
- Not cash, no.

412
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,720
Taking your own life. Interesting expression - taking it from who?

413
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,560
Once it's over, it's not you who'll miss it.

00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,160
Your life is not your own. Keep your hands off it.

417
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,440
You're not what I expected, you...

I have a situation that needs to be managed.

There's only one way that I can solve it.

439

And what's that?

440
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,160
- I need to kill someone.
- Who?
- Who?

441
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,520
Anyone!

442
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,320
Of course! He doesn't want to kill one person, he wants to kill anyone.

443
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,280
He's a serial killer.

444
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,520
Anyone.

445
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,160
- He could be!
- Anyone!

446
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,480
Why not? Why shouldn't he be?

447
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,920
- HORNS BEEP
- Oi, you!

448
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,600
What's the matter with you?!

449
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,480
'Anyone!'

450
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,240

What are you doing here?

453
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,880
What were you doing in the middle of a bloody street?

454
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,320
You should be at Baker Street.

455
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,200
I am. So are you.

456
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,960
They found your address, they brought you here.

457
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,320
You've had too much. And that's me saying that!

458
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,800
Kill.

459
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,160
Kill.

460
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,800
- Anyone.
- Anyone.

461
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,440
They're always poor and lonely and strange.

But those are only the ones we catch.

463

Who do we catch?

464
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,560
Serial killers.

465
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,880
What if you were rich and...

466
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,840
powerful and necessary?

467
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,440
Anyone.

468
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,040
What if you had the compulsion to kill and money? What then?!

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,040
You've no idea what I've been through!

486
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,800
Argh! Right! Argh!

487
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,120
Away! CLATTERING

488
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,920
- I'm out of here! He's lost it.
- Where is it?!

489
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,200
- He's totally gone!
- Aah!

490
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,560
Once more unto the breach, dear friends! Once more!

491
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,520
Or close the wall up with our English dead!

492
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,400
Set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide!

493
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:35,240
Hold hard the breath and build up every spirit to his full height! On!

494
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,840
On, you noblest English

495
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,600
Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!

496
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,800
And you, good yeoman,

497
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,560
Whose limbs were made in England,

498
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,920
Show us here

499
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,120
The mettle of your pasture

500
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,280
Which I doubt not

501
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,560
For there is none of you here so mean and base

502
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,880
That hath not noble lustre in your eyes!

503
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,120
I see you standing like greyhounds in the slips,

504
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,640
Straining upon the start!

505
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,240
The game's afoot.

506
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,080
Oh, hello.

507
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,680
Can I have a cup of tea?

508
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,240
Did you call the police?

509
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,280
Of course I didn't call the police, I'm not a civilian!

510
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:19,000
These pictures, they're that man on the telly, aren't they?

511
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,200
- What pictures?
- They're everywhere.

512
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,200
Oh, these pictures?! Oh, you can see them too? That's good.

513
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,440
Culverton Smith. This, I think, is relevant, from this morning.

514
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,320
He's publicly accused Mr Smith of being a serial killer.

515
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,560
Christ! Sherlock on Twitter, he really has lost it.

516
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,960
Don't you dare make jokes! Don't you dare!

517
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,200
I was terrified!

518
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,160
Cup of tea! Oh, for goodness' sakes!

519
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,520
What's the matter with you?!

520
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,920
Are you having an earthquake?!

521
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,440
- You need to see him, John, you need to help him!
- No.
- He needs you!

522
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,520
Somebody else! Not me, not now.

523
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,840
Now, you just listen to me, for once in your stupid life!

524
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,720
I know Mary's dead and I know your heart is broken,

525
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,840
but if Sherlock Holmes dies too, who will you have then?

526
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,760
Because I'll tell you something, John Watson, you will not have me!

527
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,840
MRS HUDSON CRIES

528
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,080
Have you spoken to Mycroft? Molly? Anyone?

529
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,680
They don't matter, you do. Would you just see him? Please, John.

530
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,160
Or just take a look at him as a doctor.

531
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,920
I know you'd change your mind if you did.

532
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,360
Yeah, look, OK, maybe, if I get a chance.

533
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,880
Do you promise?

534
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,840
I'll try, if I'm in the area.

535
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,440
Promise me?

536
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,240
- I promise.
- Thank you.

537
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,000
Well, on you go. Examine him.

538
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,640
Right then, mister! Now, I need your handcuffs.

539
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,760
I happen to know there's a pair in the salad drawer.

540
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,640
I've borrowed them before.

541
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,840
Oh, get over yourself! You're not my first smackhead, Sherlock Holmes!

542
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,600
Woman's out of control! I asked for a cup of tea!

543
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,960
- How did you get him in the boot?
- The boys from the cafe.

544
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,160
They dropped me! Twice!

545
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,160
And do you know why they dropped you, dear?

546
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,400
Because they know you.

547
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,760
Who's this one? Is this a new person?

548
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,280
- I'm against new people.
- Excuse me for a moment.

549
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,280
She's my therapist.

550
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,240
Awesome! Do you do block bookings?

551
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,120
- Whose car is that?
- That's my car.

552
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,520
How can that be your car?!

553
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,960
Oh, for God's sake!

554
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,800
I'm the widow of a drug dealer, I own property in central London,

555
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,000
and for the last bloody time, John, I'm not your housekeeper!

556
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,200
I'm so sorry, I answered your phone, you were busy.

557
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,560
I think you'll want to take it.

558
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,000
Yes, hello?

559
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,560
Is this Dr John Watson?

560
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,600
Yeah, who's this?

561
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,560
Culverton Smith. You've probably heard of me.

562
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,920
Um, well, yes.

563
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,680
Get me a fresh glass of water, please, this one's filthy.

564
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,040
'I mean, I'm aware of this morning's developments.'

565
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,840
Yes, I'm sure he was being hilarious.

566
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,800
Sorry, did you say "all still meeting"?

567
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,600
'You, me and Mr Holmes.'

568
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,560
I've sent a car, should be outside.

569
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,360
Mr Holmes gave me an address.

570
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,920
Well, he couldn't have given you this one...

571
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,960
DOORBELL RINGS

572
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,080
When you're ready.

573
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,320
- When did Sherlock give you this address?
- Two weeks ago.
- Two weeks?

574
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,840
'Yes, two weeks.'

575
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,280
PHONE CALL ENDS

576
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,080
How did you know where to find me?

577
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,680
Oh, Sherlock told me.

578
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,480
He's not so difficult when you've got a gun on him.

579
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,480
How did you know?! How? On Monday, I decided to get a new therapist.

580
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,160
Tuesday afternoon, I chose her.

581
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,720
Wednesday morning, I booked today's session.

582
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,920
Now, today is Friday. So two weeks ago,

583
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,280
two weeks before you were abducted at gunpoint

584
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,800
and brought here against your will,

585
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,040
over a week before I even thought of coming here,

586
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,880
you knew exactly where you'd need to be picked up for lunch?!

587
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,760
Really? I correctly anticipated

588
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,120
the responses of people I know well to scenarios I devised.

589
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,320
- Can't everyone do that?
- How?

590
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,120
Except the boot. The boot was mean!

591
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,080
Never mind how, he's dying to tell us that.

592
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,400
I want to know why?

593
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,080
Because Mrs Hudson's right. I'm burning up.

594
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,720
I'm at the bottom of a pit and I'm still falling,

595
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,480
and I'm never climbing out.

596
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,080
I need you to know, John.

597
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,200
I need you to see that up here, I've still got it.

598
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,920
So, when I tell you that this is the most dangerous,

599
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,520
the most despicable human being that I have ever encountered,

600
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,440
when I tell you that this, this monster must be ended,

601
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,680
please remember where you are standing, because you're standing

602
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,040
exactly where I said you would be two weeks ago.

603
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:39,040
I'm a mess, I'm in hell, but I am not wrong, not about him.

604
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,800
So, what has all this got to do with me?

605
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,040
That creature, that rotting thing

606
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,320
is a living, breathing coagulation of human evil.

607
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,120
And if the only thing I ever do in this world is drive him out of it,

608
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,920
then my life will not have been wasted.

609
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,040
Look at me!

610
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,440
Can't do it, not now.

611
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,760
Not alone.

612
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,320
All right.

613
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,840
Yeah, well, they're real enough, I suppose.

614
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,800
- Why would I be faking?
- Because you're a liar!

615
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,640
You lie all the time, it's like your mission!

616
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,840
I have been many things, John, but when have I ever been a malingerer?!

617
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,760
You pretended to be dead for two years!

618
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,800
- Apart from that!
- Listen, before I do anything,

619
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,360
I need to know what state you're in.

620
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,840
Well, you're a doctor, examine me.

621
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,600
No, I need a second opinion.

622
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,960
Oh, John, calm down. When have you ever managed two opinions?

623
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,600
You'd fall over.

624
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,720
I need the one person who,

625
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,080
unlike me, learned to see through your bullshit long ago.

626
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,120
Who's that, then? I'm sure I would have noticed.

627
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,840
The last person you'd think of.

628
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,120
I want you to be examined by Molly Hooper.

629
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,960
Do you hear me? I said Molly Hooper.

630
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,080
You're really not going to like this.

631
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,480
- Like what?
- DOORBELL RINGS

632
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,200
Um, hello. Is, er... I'm sorry, Sherlock asked me to come.

633
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,680
- What, two weeks ago?
- Yeah, about two weeks.

634
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,800
If you'd like to know how I predict the future...

635
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,080
- No, I don't care how!
- OK, a fully equipped ambulance,

636
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,120
Molly can examine me on the way, it'll save time.

637
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,520
- Ready to go, Molly?
- Um, well...

638
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,880
Just tell me when to cough.

639
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,560
I hope you remembered my coat.

640
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,640
I'm sorry, I didn't know that you were going to be here.

641
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,840
Absolutely no idea what's going on.

642
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,720
Sherlock's using again.

643
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,400
Oh, God! Um, are...are you sure?

644
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,920
No, it's Sherlock, of course I'm not sure! Check him out.

645
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,280
Is Molly the right person to be doing medicals?

646
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,680
She's more used to dead people.

647
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,200
It's bound to lower your standards.

648
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,160
I don't know. Yeah, I don't know anything any more.

649
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,320
- Mrs Hudson, as ever, you are amazing.
- No.

650
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,560
You're going to have to buck up a bit, John, you know that, don't you?

651
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,240
The game is on.

652
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,400
I'll do my best.

653
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,640
Anything you need, any time, just ask, anything at all.

654
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,720
Thank you.

655
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,280
Er, sometimes, can I borrow your car?

656
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,400
- No.
- OK.

657
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,320
He knew you'd get a new therapist after I died,

658
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,400
because you'd need to change everything.

659
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,120
That's just what you're like.

660
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,000
Thanks.

661
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,400
You keep your weekends for Rosie,

662
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,480
so you needed to see someone during working hours.

663
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,600
Because you're an idiot,

664
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,160
you don't want anyone at the surgery knowing you're in therapy,

665
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,960
so that restricts you to lunchtime sessions,

666
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,160
with someone reasonably close.

667
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,800
You found four men and one woman.

668
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,920
And you are done with the world being explained to you by a man.

669
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,800
Well, who isn't? So all he needed to do

670
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,080
was find the first available lunchtime appointment

671
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,960
with a female therapist within cycling distance of your surgery.

672
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,000
My God, he knows you!

673
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,520
No, he doesn't.

674
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,400
I'm in your head, John. You're disagreeing with yourself.

675
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,640
Are you ready, sir?

676
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,880
Yes, I am.

677
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,600
He is the cleverest man in the world, but he's not a monster.

678
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:07,160
- Yeah, he is.
- Yeah, OK, all right, he is. Agh! But he's our monster.

679
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,400
I'm a killer.

680
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,640
You know I'm a killer.

681
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,360
But did you know I'm a s...

682
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,680
- LIGHT BULB EXPLODES
- Cut there! What was that?

683
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,960
Was that a light?

684
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,520
Er, was that me? Was I too good?

685
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,400
- Huh?
- He's here.

686
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,080
Well, how is he?

687
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,280
Basically fine.

688
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,760
I've seen healthier people on the slab.

689
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,880
Yeah, but to be fair, you work with murder victims.

690
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,080
They tend to be quite young.

691
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,240
- Not funny.
- A little bit funny.
- If you keep taking

692
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,920
what you're taking at the rate you're taking it, you've got weeks.

693
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,920
Exactly, weeks! Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

694
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,080
For Christ's sake, Sherlock, it's not a game!

695
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,200
I'm worried about you, Molly, you seem very stressed.

696
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,480
- I'm stressed, you're dying!
- Yeah, well, I'm ahead, then.

697
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,920
Stress can ruin every day of your life. Dying can only ruin one.

698
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,680
So this is real? You've really lost it?

699
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,440
- You're actually out of control?
- When have I ever been that?

700
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,280
- Since the day I met you.
- Oh, clever boy.

701
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,000
I've missed you bumbling round the place.

702
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,960
- I thought this was some kind of...
- What?
- Trick.

703
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,720
This is not a trick, it's a plan.

704
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,760
Mr Holmes!

705
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,720
30 feet and closing, the most significant undetected serial killer

706
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,440
- in British criminal history. Help me bring him down.
- What? What plan?

707
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,200
- I'm not telling you.
- Why not?
- Because you won't like it.

708
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,240
Mr Holmes.

709
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,120
I don't do handshakes. It'll have to be a hug.

710
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,280
I know.

711
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,280
Oh, Sherlock.

712
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,000
Oh, Sherlock, what can I say?

713
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,560
Thanks to you, we're, er... we're everywhere!

714
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,800
Mr Holmes, how did Culverton talk you into this?

715
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,520
Well, he's a detective. Maybe I just confessed.

716
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,720
THEY LAUGH

717
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,680
Come on.

718
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,600
Now, it's a... it's a new kind of breakfast cereal.

719
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,080
Mr Holmes, could you put on the hat?

720
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,800
Yeah, he doesn't really wear the hat.

721
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,960
Kids will be getting two of their five-a-day

722
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,640
before they've even left home.

723
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,320
Sherlock's been amazing for us.

724
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,280
Breakfast has got to be cool.

725
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,600
We're beyond viral.

726
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,600
And you know what makes it cool when you're a kid?

727
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,080
What, sorry, beyond what?

728
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,120
Dangerous!

729
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,880
And action!

730
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,920
I'm a killer. You know I'm a killer.

731
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,920
But did you know

732
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,400
I'm a cereal killer?

733
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,880
Mmm!

734
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,200
And cut there, thank you.

735
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,640
We should bag that up, sell it. Make money for that on eBay.

736
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,120
You can make more if you want, any time you like.

737
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,400
Has it occurred to you, anywhere in your drug-addled brain,

738
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,840
- that you've just been played?
- Oh, yes.

739
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,640
- For an ad campaign.
- Brilliant, isn't it?
- Brilliant?

740
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,240
The safest place to hide.

741
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,640
Plain sight.

742
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,000
Mr Holmes?

743
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,440
Culverton wants to know if you're OK going straight to the hospital?

744
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,680
Hospital?

745
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,000
Culverton's doing a visit. The kids would love to meet you both.

746
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,440
I think he sort of promised.

747
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,760
Oh, OK.

748
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,640
If you'd just like to come this way.

749
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,840
So, what are we doing here? What's the point?

750
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,880
I needed a hug.

751
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,720
What do you think, Mr Holmes? Cereal killer?

752
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,480
It's funny cos it's true!

753
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,960
See you at the hospital.

754
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,080
Oh, you can have this back now.

755
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,360
- Have what back?
- Thanks for the hug.

756
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,080
Oh, I sent and deleted a text.

757
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,600
You might get a reply, but I doubt it.

758
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,160
- It's password protected.
- Oh, please!

759
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,960
CULVERTON CHUCKLES

760
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,720
We're going to have endless fun, Mr Holmes, aren't we?

761
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,960
Oh, no. No, not endless.

762
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,120
Need another hit, do you?

763
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,640
I can wait until the hospital.

764
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,840
Are you involved much?

765
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,040
Sorry?

766
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,600
Um, with Mr Holmes, Sherlock, in all his cases?

767
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,120
Er, yeah, I'm John Watson.

768
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,440
OK.

769
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,920
Dr Watson.

770
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,360
I love his blog, don't you?

771
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,520
His blog?

772
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,560
- Why, don't you read it?
- You mean my blog.

773
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,600
Say what you like about addiction, the day is full of highlights!

774
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,160
- Oh, Mr Holmes, you're feeling better?
- Psychedelic!

775
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,280
- I was just saying, I love your blog.
- Great, thanks.
- It's my blog.

776
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,000
- It is, he writes the blog.
- It's yours?
- Yes.

777
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,240
You write Sherlock's blog?

778
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,280
Yes.

779
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,800
It's gone downhill a bit, hasn't it?

780
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,560
It's this way, then.

781
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,840
- Oh, my God, I love your blog.
- You're welcome.

782
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,960
Right, here he comes, the internet tec.

783
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,680
You all know Sherlock Holmes.

784
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,160
Oh, and Dr Watson, of course.

785
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,800
Mr Holmes, I was wondering, well, we all were, weren't we,

786
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,120
maybe you could tell us about some of your cases?

787
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,200
- No.
- Yes.
- Yes. Absolutely, yes.

788
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,800
The main feature of interest in the field of criminal investigation

789
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,560
is not the sensational aspects of the crime itself,

790
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,560
but rather the iron chain of reasoning,

791
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:08,160
from cause to effect, that reveals, step by step, the solution.

792
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,000
That's the only truly remarkable aspect of the entire affair.

793
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,720
Now, I will share with you the facts and evidence as they were

794
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,000
available to me, and in this very room,

795
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,080
you will all attempt to solve the case of Blessington The Poisoner.

796
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,280
I think you slightly gave away the ending.

797
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,880
- There were five main suspects.
- One of them called Blessington.

798
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,200
- But it's more about how he did it.
- Poison?
- OK.

799
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,640
CHILDREN LAUGH

800
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:34,280
Drearcliff House, remember that one, John? One murder, ten suspects.

801
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,600
- Ten, yeah.
- All of them guilty.
- Sherlock.

802
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,400
Now, what did you call that one, John?

803
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,560
Um, something to do with murder at the zoo.

804
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,520
Yeah, I called it Murder At The Zoo.

805
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,080
Or was it the case of The Killer Orang-utan?

806
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,240
You should be wearing the hat. The kids would love the hat.

807
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,560
So, any more questions?

808
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,720
- No.
- I don't think so.
- No?

809
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,800
Mr Holmes?

810
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,720
Good, then I'll...

811
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,560
How do you catch a serial killer?

812
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,960
Same way you catch any other killer.

813
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,720
No. Most killers kill someone they know.

814
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,760
You're looking for a murderer in a tiny social grouping.

815
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,120
Um, Mr Smith, I'm just wondering,

816
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,920
maybe this isn't a suitable subject for the children.

817
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,480
Nurse Cornish, how long have you been with us now?

818
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,840
Seven years.

819
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,760
Seven years.

820
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,680
OK.

821
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,200
Serial killers choose their victims at random.

822
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,520
Surely that must make it more difficult.

823
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,120
Some of them advertise.

824
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,440
Do they really?

825
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,360
Serial killing is an expression of power, ego -

826
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,200
a signature in human destruction.

827
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:58,760
Ultimately, for full satisfaction, it requires plain sight.

828
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,160
Additionally, serial killers are easily profiled.

829
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,520
They tend to be social outcasts, educationally subnormal.

830
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,480
No, no, no, no, no, no.

831
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,720
You're just talking about the ones you know. The ones you've caught.

832
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,840
But hello, dummy, you only catch the dumb ones.

833
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:19,000
Now, imagine if the Queen wanted to kill some people,

834
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,520
what would happen then?

835
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,720
All that power, all that money,

836
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,840
sweet little government, dancing attendants.

837
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:30,240
A whole country just to keep her warm and fat.

838
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,280
Hmm. We all love the Queen, don't we?

839
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,800
And I bet she'd love you lot.

840
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,160
It's all right, everyone, I can personally assure you

841
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,520
that Sherlock Holmes is not about to arrest the Queen.

842
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,640
Well, of course not. Not Her Majesty.

843
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:52,760
Money, power, fame - some things make you untouchable.

844
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,040
God save the Queen!

845
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,000
She could open a slaughterhouse

846
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,960
and we'd all probably pay the entrance fee.

847
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,000
- No-one's untouchable.
- No-one?

848
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:09,000
Look at you all, so gloomy. Can't you take a joke?

849
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,120
The Queen!

850
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:16,840
If the Queen was a serial killer, I'd be the first person she'd tell.

851
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,520
We have that kind of friendship.

852
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:24,120
A big round of applause for Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson.

853
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,800
Come on. Wonderful.

854
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,120
Thank you so much for coming. Thank you.

855
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,880
Where are we going now?

856
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,720
I want to show you my favourite room.

857
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,760
No, let's go in here.

858
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,000
So you've had another one of your little meetings?

859
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,480
Oh, it's just a monthly top-up.

860
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,680
Confession is good for the soul, providing you can delete it.

861
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,720
What's TD 12?

862
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,480
It's a memory inhibitor.

863
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,160
Bliss.

864
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,680
Bliss?

865
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,200
Opt-in ignorance. It makes the world go round.

866
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,080
Anyone ever opt to remember?

867
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,360
Some people take the drip out, yes.

868
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,760
Some people have the same urges.

869
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,760
Now, come on, wasting time.

870
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,480
Indeed, you have, I estimate, 20 minutes left.

871
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,080
- Sorry?
- I sent a text from your phone, remember?

872
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,640
It was read almost immediately.

873
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,000
Factoring in a degree of shock and emotional decision,

874
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,480
and a journey time based on the associated address,

875
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,920
I'd say that your life, as you know it, has 20 minutes left to run.

876
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,360
Well, no, 17 to be precise,

877
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,840
but I rounded up for dramatic effect.

878
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,200
So, please do show us your favourite room.

879
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,200
It'll give you a chance to say goodbye.

880
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,000
CULVERTON CHUCKLES

881
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,560
Come along.

882
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,360
The game is on. Do you still miss me?

883
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,920
Speaking of serial killers, you know who's my favourite?

884
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,600
Other than yourself?

885
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,800
HH Holmes. Relative of yours?

886
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,840
Not as far as I know.

887
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,240
You should check. What an idiot.

888
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,440
Everyone out.

889
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,280
Mr Smith, we're actually in the middle of something.

890
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,720
Saheed, isn't it?

891
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,720
Saheed, yes.

892
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,880
How long have you been working here now?

893
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,680
- Four years.
- Four years. Well, that's a long time, isn't it?

894
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,400
Four years!

895
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,800
OK, everyone.

896
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,800
Five minutes?

897
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,120
Come back in ten.

898
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,720
Saheed...

899
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,240
this time, knock.

900
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,000
How can you do that?

901
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,680
I mean, how are you even allowed in here?

902
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,400
Oh, I can go anywhere I like.

903
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,720
Anywhere at all.

904
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,080
They gave you keys?

905
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,000
They presented them to me. There was a ceremony.

906
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,160
You can watch that on YouTube. Home Secretary was there.

907
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,720
So, your favourite room - the mortuary?

908
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,080
What do you think?

909
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,120
Tough crowd.

910
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,240
Oh, I don't know.

911
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:25,280
Hmm. I've always found them quite pliable.

912
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,000
- Don't do that!
- She's fine. She's dead.

913
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,520
HH Holmes loved the dead.

914
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,040
He mass-produced them.

915
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,440
Serial killer, active during the Chicago Fair.

916
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,640
Do you know what he did?

917
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,720
He built a hotel, a special hotel just to kill people.

918
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:48,480
You know, with a hanging room, gas chamber, specially adapted furnace.

919
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,400
You know, like Sweeney Todd...

920
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,960
"Without the pies!"

921
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,800
Stupid. So stupid.

922
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,000
Why stupid?

923
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,120
Well, all that effort.

924
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,080
You don't build a beach if you want to hide a pebble.

925
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,480
You just find a beach.

926
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,240
And if you want to hide a murder,

927
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:15,200
if you want to hide lots and lots of murders, just find a...

928
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,840
..hospital.

929
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,640
Can we be clear? Are you confessing?

930
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,400
To what?

931
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,920
The way you're talking...

932
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,160
Oh, sorry, yes.

933
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,840
You mean, am I a serial killer?

934
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,080
Or am I just trying to mess with your funny little head?

935
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,720
Well, it's true.

936
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,400
I do like to mess with people, and, yes, I am a bit creepy.

937
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,720
But that's just my USP.

938
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,960
I use it to sell breakfast cereal.

939
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,280
But am I what he says I am?

940
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,040
Is that what you're asking?

941
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,640
Yes.

942
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:58,440
Hmm. Well, let me ask you this... are you really a doctor?

943
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,760
Yeah, of course I am.

944
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,160
Oh, no, a medical doctor?

945
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:06,240
You know, not just feet or media studies or something?

946
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,280
I'm a doctor.

947
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,760
Are you serious?

948
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,280
No, really, are you?

949
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,200
Are you...

950
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,200
are you actually serious?

951
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,880
I've played along with this joke, it's not funny any more.

952
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,080
Look at him!

953
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,040
Go ahead, look at him, Dr Watson!

954
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,680
Hmm. Oh, no, I'll lay it out for you.

955
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,600
There are two possible explanations for what's going on here.

956
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,040
Either I'm a serial killer,

957
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,080
or Sherlock Holmes is off his tits on drugs!

958
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:46,920
Hmm? Delusional paranoia about a public personality.

959
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,560
That's not so special, it's not even new.

960
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:52,560
I think you need to tell your faithful little friend

961
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,280
how you're wasting his time,

962
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:58,600
because you're too high to know what's real any more.

963
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,840
I apologise.

964
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,920
I...I've miscalculated.

965
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,000
I forgot to factor in the traffic.

966
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,400
19 minutes.

967
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,160
LIFT STOPS

968
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,200
Ah, the footsteps you're about to hear will be very familiar to you,

969
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,200
not least because there'll be three impacts rather than two.

970
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,800
The third, of course, will be the end of a walking cane.

971
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,200
LIFT PINGS

972
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,800
Your daughter Faith's walking cane.

973
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,760
And why would she be here?

974
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,440
You invited her. You sent her a text.

975
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,720
- Or technically,
- I
- sent her a text, but she's not to know.

976
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,040
Now, let's see if I can recall.

977
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:49,800
"Faith, I can stand it no longer, I've confessed to my crimes.

978
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,080
"Please forgive me."

979
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,400
Why would that have any effect? You don't know her.

980
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,480
Oh, but I do. I spent a whole evening with her.

981
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,960
We had chips. I think she liked me.

982
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,480
You don't know Faith. You simply do not.

983
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,320
I know you care about her deeply.

984
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,560
I know you invited her to one of your special board meetings.

985
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,640
You care what she thinks.

986
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,640
You maintain an impressive facade.

987
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,160
I think it's about to break.

988
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,320
Did you know?

989
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,840
She came to Baker Street.

990
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,160
No, she didn't.

991
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,320
Of course I didn't.

992
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:34,960
She came to see me, because she was scared of her daddy.

993
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:40,240
Never happened. Is this another one of your drug-fuelled fantasies?

994
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,680
- You didn't see him take the scalpel?
- Nobody saw him.

995
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,440
So you didn't know what was about to happen?

996
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:45,920
Of course I didn't know.

997
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,080
Well, let's see, shall we?

998
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,360
Faith, stop loitering at the door and come in.

999
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,560
This is your father's favourite room!

1000
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,840
Come and meet his best friends.

1001
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:00,040
Dad? What's happening?

1002
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:03,760
What was that text? Are you having one of your jokes?

1003
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,400
Who are you?

1004
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,360
Who the hell are you?!

1005
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,360
It's Sherlock Holmes, surely you recognise him?

1006
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,600
Oh, my God! Sherlock Holmes!

1007
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,000
I love your blog.

1008
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,560
You're not her, you're not the woman who came to Baker Street.

1009
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,760
Um, well, no. Never been there.

1010
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,920
Well, there must have been some build-up,

1011
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,560
he didn't just suddenly do it.

1012
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,560
Look, I didn't know he had the bloody scalpel!

1013
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,160
Sorry, I'm not sure I completely understand.

1014
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,680
Understand what?

1015
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,800
Well, I thought you two were... were old friends?

1016
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,920
No. We've never met.

1017
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,160
Oh, dear. Oh!

1018
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,680
Have we?

1019
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,440
Sherlock?

1020
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,520
So, who came to my flat?

1021
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,080
Well, it wasn't me.

1022
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,520
No!

1023
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,720
HE LAUGHS

1024
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,760
You look different.

1025
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,280
I wasn't there.

1026
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,560
'Who came to my flat?'

1027
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,680
I'm sorry, Mr Holmes,

1028
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,480
but I don't think I've ever been anywhere near your flat.

1029
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,840
Oh, dear. Oh, no!

1030
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,240
Who are you talking to?

1031
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,120
What friend?

1032
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,360
Anyone.

1033
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,200
Oh, no. Oh, no!

1034
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,440
HE LAUGHS

1035
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,320
'Faith?

1036
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,040
'Oh, God!'

1037
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,880
Oh, no. Oh, no!

1038
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,360
HE LAUGHS

1039
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,280
Sherlock?

1040
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,440
Sherlock, are you all right? Sherlock, are you OK?

1041
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,560
- Watch him, he's got a knife.
- I've got a what?

1042
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,600
You've got a scalpel, you picked it up from that table! I saw you take it.

1043
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,160
I certainly did not!

1044
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,600
Look behind his back!

1045
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,760
No...

1046
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,360
I saw you take it! I saw you!

1047
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1048
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,280
Sherlock, do you want to put that down?

1049
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,480
Oh, my God!

1050
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,800
Stop laughing at me.

1051
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,880
- I'm not laughing.
- He's not laughing, Sherlock.

1052
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,680
- Stop laughing at me!
- Sherlock!

1053
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:30,120
Oh, Christ! I keep wondering if we should have seen it coming.

1054
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,280
Not long ago he shot Charles Magnussen in the face,

1055
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,440
we did see it coming.

1056
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,040
We always saw it coming. But it was fun.

1057
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,400
KNOCK ON DOOR

1058
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,680
Come in.

1059
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,440
Sir, you probably want to see this.

1060
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,800
- ON LAPTOP:
- 'Harold Chorley reporting earlier today.

1061
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,200
'Mr Smith stated he had no interest in bringing charges.'

1062
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,040
'I'm a fan of Sherlock Holmes, I'm a big fan.

1063
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:57,640
'I don't really know what happened today. To be honest,

1064
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:02,040
'I don't think I'd be standing here now if it wasn't for Dr Watson.'

1065
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,120
Stop laughing at me!

1066
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,560
Sherlock!

1067
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,400
CLATTER

1068
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,000
Stop it! Stop it now!

1069
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,880
- NEWSREADER:
- 'Is it true he's being treated in your hospital?'

1070
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,680
'It's not actually my hospital.'

1071
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,560
Well, it is a little bit my hospital.

1072
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:20,920
But I can promise you this, he is going to get the best of care.

1073
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,560
I might even move him to my favourite room.

1074
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,600
- NEWSREADER:
- 'Culverton Smith, earlier today. In Nottingham...'

1075
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,960
He's right, you know, you probably saved his life.

1076
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,640
What are you doing?! Wake up!

1077
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,280
I really hit him, Greg. Hit him hard.

1078
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:47,240
Is this a game? Is it just a bloody game?

1079
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,440
HOLMES GROANS

1080
00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:00,560
Please! Please, please, please, no violence. Thank you, Dr Watson.

1081
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:04,960
But I don't think he's a danger any more.

1082
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,320
Leave him be.

1083
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,320
No, it's OK.

1084
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:15,120
Let him do what he wants. He's entitled.

1085
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,520
I killed his wife.

1086
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,520
Yes, you did.

1087
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,200
Oh, hi.

1088
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,280
HE MOUTHS

1089
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,800
Just in to say hello?

1090
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,360
No. I'm just in to say goodbye.

1091
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,440
I'm sure he'll pull through.

1092
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,640
And yeah, he's made a terrible mess of himself, but he's awfully strong.

1093
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,440
So, must look on the bright side.

1094
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,200
Hm.

1095
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,240
Well...

1096
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,720
- Parting gift.
- Ah, that's nice.

1097
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,120
A walking stick.

1098
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,560
Yeah, it was mine, from a long time ago.

1099
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,440
PHONE RINGS

1100
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,960
Hello? Ward 73.

1101
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,920
Oh, er, Dr Watson?

1102
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,080
Hm?

1103
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,520
It's for you.

1104
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,640
Oh.

1105
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,960
Hello, Mycroft.

1106
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,280
'There's a car downstairs.'

1107
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,360
You know, he should definitely have worn the hat.

1108
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,840
Still thinking about Sherlock?

1109
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,160
No. You are.

1110
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,240
You've got your disapproving face on.

1111
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,120
Well, seeing as I'm inside your head,

1112
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,840
I think we can call that self-loathing.

1113
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,320
- Where is she? Where's Mrs Hudson?
- She'll be up in a moment.

1114
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:02,600
What are you doing?

1115
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,360
Have you noticed the kitchen? It's practically a meth lab.

1116
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:08,320
I'm trying to establish exactly what drove Sherlock off the rails.

1117
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,040
- Any ideas?
- Are these spooks?

1118
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,720
Are you using spooks now to look after your family?

1119
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,560
- Hang on, are they tidying?
- Sherlock is a security concern.

1120
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,520
The fact that I'm his brother changes nothing.

1121
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,840
- Yeah, you've said that before.
- Ask him.

1122
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,720
Why fixate on Culverton Smith?

1123
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,920
He's had his obsessions before, of course, but

1124
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,720
this goes a bit further than setting a man-trap for Father Christmas.

1125
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,200
Do it. Ask him.

1126
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,560
Spending all night talking to a woman who wasn't even there.

1127
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:34,720
Oh, shut up, you!

1128
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,440
- Mycroft, last time, when we were on the phone...
- No, no, no, no, stop.

1129
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,840
I detest conversation in the past tense.

1130
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,400
You said the fact that you were his brother made no difference.

1131
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,880
It doesn't.

1132
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:46,400
You said it didn't the last time, and it wouldn't with Sherlock.

1133
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,520
So who was it the last time? Who were you talking about?

1134
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:49,680
Attaboy!

1135
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:53,200
Nobody. I...misspoke.

1136
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,920
- He's lying.
- You're lying.

1137
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,080
- I assure you, I'm not.
- He really is lying.

1138
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,360
Sherlock's not your only brother.

1139
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,800
There's another one, isn't there?

1140
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,760
- No...
- Jesus! A secret brother.

1141
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,160
What is he, locked up in a tower, or something?

1142
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,560
Mycroft Holmes!

1143
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:14,440
What are all these dreadful people doing in my house?!

1144
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,520
Mrs Hudson, I apologise for the interruption.

1145
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,600
As you know, my brother has embarked on

1146
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,840
a programme of self-destruction remarkable even by his standards,

1147
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,400
and I am endeavouring to find out what triggered it.

1148
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,800
- And that's what you're all looking for?
- Quite so.

1149
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,920
- What's on his mind?
- So to speak.

1150
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,480
And you've had all this time?

1151
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,080
Time being something of which we don't have an infinite supply,

1152
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,320
so if we could be about our business.

1153
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,680
SHE GIGGLES

1154
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,040
You...you're so funny, you are!

1155
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,680
Mrs Hudson?

1156
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:45,720
He thinks you're clever, poor old Sherlock. Always going on about you.

1157
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,240
I mean, he knows you're an idiot,

1158
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,400
but that's OK, cos you're a lovely doctor.

1159
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,560
But he has no idea what an idiot you are!

1160
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,720
Is this merely stream-of-consciousness abuse,

1161
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,480
or are you attempting to make a point?

1162
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,400
You want to know what's bothering Sherlock?

1163
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,200
Easiest thing in the world, anyone can do it.

1164
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,160
I know his thought processes better than any other human being,

1165
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,640
so, please, try to understand.

1166
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:08,560
He's not about thinking. Not Sherlock.

1167
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,320
- Of course he is.
- No, no.

1168
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,400
He's more emotional, isn't he?

1169
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,840
Unsolved case, shoot the wall! Boom, boom!

1170
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:18,320
Unmade breakfast, karate the fridge.

1171
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,560
Unanswered question...

1172
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:23,800
Well, what does he do with anything he can't answer, John? Every time?

1173
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,360
He stabs it.

1174
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:30,320
Anything he can't find the answer for, bang! It's up there.

1175
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:33,280
I keep telling him, if he was any good as a detective,

1176
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,080
I wouldn't need a new mantel!

1177
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:43,360
- MARY:
- 'If you're watching this, I'm...probably dead.'

1178
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:46,240
OK, no. Stop that now, please.

1179
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,360
Everybody out, now!

1180
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,240
All of you!

1181
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:54,440
This is my house, this is my friend, and that's his departed wife.

1182
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,560
Anyone who stays here a minute longer is admitting to me personally

1183
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,440
they do not have a single spark of human decency.

1184
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:13,720
Get out of my house, you reptile!

1185
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,400
You've been ages waking up.

1186
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,640
I watched you.

1187
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,720
It was quite lovely, in its way.

1188
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:34,640
Take it easy, it's OK.

1189
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,400
Don't want to rush this.

1190
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,440
You're Sherlock Holmes.

1191
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,000
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.

1192
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,760
'Might be the hardest case of your career.

1193
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,480
'When I'm...gone,

1194
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,480
'if I'm gone,

1195
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,480
'I need you to do something for me.

1196
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,560
'Save John Watson.

1197
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:00,120
'Save him, Sherlock.'

1198
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,560
John, if you want to watch this later...

1199
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,360
'Save him.

1200
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,480
'Don't think anyone else is going to save him,

1201
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,920
'because there isn't anyone.

1202
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,720
'It's up to you.

1203
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,080
'Save him.

1204
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:13,720
'But I do think you're going to need a little bit of help with that,

1205
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,640
'because you're not exactly good with people,

1206
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:19,520
'so here's a few things you need to know about the man we both love.

1207
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:22,560
'And more importantly, what you're going to need to do to save him.'

1208
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,240
How did you...get in?

1209
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,400
Policeman outside, you mean?

1210
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,120
Come on, can't you guess?

1211
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:39,840
Secret door.

1212
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,520
I built this whole wing.

1213
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,280
I kept firing the architects and builders,

1214
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:50,320
so no-one knew quite how it all fitted together.

1215
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:54,640
I can slip in and out, anywhere I like, you know.

1216
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,520
When I get the urge.

1217
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,880
HH Holmes.

1218
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:02,800
Murder Castle. But done right.

1219
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:07,120
I have a question for you. Why are you here?

1220
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,640
It's like you walked into my den and laid down in front of me.

1221
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,960
Why?

1222
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,200
You know why I'm here.

1223
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,160
I'd like to hear you say it.

1224
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,120
Say it for me, please.

1225
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,600
I want you to kill me.

1226
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,720
HIGH-TEMPO MUSIC

1227
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,000
- MRS HUDSON:
- John?

1228
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:35,680
My car.

1229
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:43,320
If you increased the dosage four or five times,

1230
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:47,160
toxic shock should shut me down within about an hour.

1231
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,640
Then I restore the settings.

1232
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:52,280
Everyone assumes it was a fault, or...

1233
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,440
- ..you just gave up the ghost.
- Yes.

1234
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,920
You're rather good at this.

1235
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,320
Before we start, tell me how you feel.

1236
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,400
I...I feel scared.

1237
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Be more specific.

1238
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,040
You only get to do this the once.

1239
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,560
I'm scared of dying.

1240
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,440
You wanted this, though.

1241
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,880
I have reasons.

1242
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:28,560
But you don't actually WANT to die.

1243
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,200
No.

1244
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,360
Good.

1245
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:35,520
Say that for me.

1246
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,640
- Say it.
- I don't want to die.

1247
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:41,880
And again.

1248
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,440
I don't...want to die.

1249
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,720
- WHISPERS:
- Once more, for luck.

1250
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,600
VOICE BREAKS: I don't want to die.

1251
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,560
I don't.

1252
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,040
I don't want to die.

1253
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,040
Lovely.

1254
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,360
Here it comes.

1255
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,280
Please, I don't think he's safe.

1256
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,480
- LESTRADE:
- 'No, he's fine, I've got a man on the door.'

1257
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,760
- 'What do you think's happened?'
- I don't know, something!

1258
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:20,720
- Mary left a message.
- What message?

1259
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:24,560
'John Watson never accepts help.

1260
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,760
'Not from anyone, not ever.

1261
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,280
'But here's the thing - he never refuses it.

1262
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,640
'So, here's what you are going to do.'

1263
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,840
So, tell me, why are we doing this?

1264
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,240
To what do I owe the pleasure?

1265
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,440
I wanted to hear your confession,

1266
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,920
needed to know I was right.

1267
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,240
But why do you need to die?

1268
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:48,720
The mortuary, your favourite room.

1269
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:52,960
You talk to the dead.

1270
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,480
You make your confession to them.

1271
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:01,040
Sorry, sir, what? What do you mean?

1272
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:04,280
I think the door's jammed.

1273
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,600
Oh, has that door locked itself again?

1274
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,080
Yeah, it's always doing that.

1275
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:11,320
'You can't save John, because he won't let you.

1276
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:13,640
'He won't allow himself to be saved.

1277
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:19,560
'The only way to save John is to make him save you.'

1278
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,800
Why do you do it?

1279
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,080
Why do I kill?

1280
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:28,520
It's not about hatred, or...or revenge.

1281
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,400
I'm not a dark person.

1282
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,240
Killing human beings...

1283
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:37,080
HE CHUCKLES

1284
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:45,120
..it just makes me... oh, incredibly happy.

1285
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:56,280
You know, in films, when you see dead people - pretending to be dead,

1286
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:59,200
and it's just living people lying down?

1287
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:03,880
Well, that's not what dead people look like.

1288
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,920
Dead people...look like things.

1289
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:12,760
I like to make people into things,

1290
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:15,160
then you can own them.

1291
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:18,040
You know what? I'm getting a little impatient.

1292
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,440
Take a big breath if you want.

1293
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,440
'Go to hell, Sherlock.

1294
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:44,720
'Go right into hell and make it look like you mean it.'

1295
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:47,800
Murder is a very difficult addiction to manage.

1296
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,440
People don't realise how much work goes into it.

1297
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,000
You have to be careful.

1298
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,040
But if you're rich or famous and...loved,

1299
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:59,720
it's amazing what people are prepared to ignore.

1300
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:04,200
But there's always someone desperate about to go missing,

1301
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,760
and no-one wants to suspect murder

1302
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,800
if it's easier to suspect something else.

1303
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,920
I just have to ration myself, choose the right heart to stop.

1304
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:20,360
'Go and pick a fight with a bad guy, put yourself in harm's way.'

1305
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:23,280
(Please! Maintain eye contact.

1306
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,240
(Maintain eye contact.

1307
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,400
(Maintain eye contact!

1308
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:31,120
(I like to watch it happen.)

1309
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,640
'If he thinks you need him, I swear...'

1310
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:43,440
(And off we...pop.)

1311
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,560
'..he will be there.'

1312
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,880
MONITORS BEEP RAPIDLY

1313
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,560
- SHERLOCK GASPS FOR AIR
- Mr Holmes, are you OK?

1314
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:54,280
What were you doing to him?! What were you doing?!

1315
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:57,320
- He's in distress, I'm helping him.
- Restrain him now. Do it.

1316
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,880
I was trying to help him!

1317
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:02,360
- Sherlock, what was he doing to you?
- Suffocating me, overdosing me.

1318
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,960
- On what?
- Saline.
- Saline?
- Yes, saline.

1319
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,880
- What do you mean, saline?
- SHERLOCK GROANS

1320
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:10,440
Well, obviously, I got Nurse Cornish to switch the bags.

1321
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:13,280
She's a big fan, you know? Loves my blog.

1322
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,680
- You're OK?
- No, no, of course I'm not OK.

1323
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:17,360
Malnourished, double kidney failure,

1324
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,360
and frankly, I've been off my tits for weeks.

1325
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,080
What kind of a doctor are you?

1326
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:23,200
SHERLOCK GROANS

1327
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,880
I got my confession, though, didn't I?

1328
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:27,720
Well, I don't recall making any confession.

1329
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:30,520
- What would I be confessing to?
- You can listen to it later.

1330
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:32,800
Well, there is no confession to listen to.

1331
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:36,080
Oh, Mr Holmes, I don't know if this is relevant, but...

1332
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:40,200
we found three potential recording devices in the pockets of your coat.

1333
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,080
All your possessions were searched.

1334
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,280
Sorry!

1335
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,240
Must be something comforting about the number three,

1336
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:52,040
people always give up after three.

1337
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:57,640
What? What is it? What?

1338
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,720
JOHN SIGHS

1339
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:05,240
- You cock!
- Yeah.

1340
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,920
- Utter, utter cock.
- Heard you the first time.

1341
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,880
- So, how does it open?
- Screw the top.

1342
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,000
- Two weeks ago?
- Three.

1343
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,760
- I'm that predictable?
- No.

1344
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,240
I'm just a cock.

1345
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,520
It's funny.

1346
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:48,040
I never realised confessing would be so enjoyable.

1347
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:49,960
I should have done it sooner.

1348
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,600
We'll carry on tomorrow.

1349
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,920
Well, we could carry on now, I'm not tired.

1350
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,320
There's loads more.

1351
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,040
Tomorrow.

1352
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:03,520
You know, I am going to be so famous now.

1353
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,320
You're already famous.

1354
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:07,520
Yeah, but with this...

1355
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,800
..I can break America.

1356
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,800
I had, of course, several other backup plans.

1357
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:20,560
Trouble is, I couldn't remember what they were.

1358
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,360
And, of course, I hadn't really anticipated

1359
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:26,040
that I'd hallucinated meeting his daughter.

1360
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,760
Basically, he trashed himself on drugs so that you'd help him,

1361
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,960
so that you'd have something to do, something doctory.

1362
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,240
You get that now?

1363
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:34,440
Still a bit troubled by the daughter.

1364
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,160
It did seem very real.

1365
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:39,080
She gave me information I couldn't have acquired elsewhere.

1366
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,160
But she wasn't ever here?

1367
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,400
Interesting, isn't it?

1368
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,720
I have theorised before that if one could attenuate to

1369
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:47,040
every available data stream in the world simultaneously,

1370
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:50,280
it would be possible to anticipate and deduce almost anything.

1371
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,200
Hmm.

1372
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:56,280
So, you dreamed up a magic woman who told you things you didn't know?

1373
01:15:56,280 --> 01:16:00,080
Well, sounds about right to me. Possibly, I'm biased.

1374
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:03,920
Perhaps the drugs opened certain doors in my mind.

1375
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,320
- I'm intrigued.
- I know you are.

1376
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,560
Which is why we're all taking it in turns to keep you off the sweeties.

1377
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,280
I thought we were just hanging out.

1378
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,000
Molly will be here in 20 minutes.

1379
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,440
Oh, I do think I can last 20 minutes without supervision.

1380
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,600
Well, if you're sure.

1381
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,480
Christ, John, stay, talk!

1382
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,680
Uh, sorry, it's just, um, you know, Rosie.

1383
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,240
Yes, of course, Rosie.

1384
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:37,360
Go and solve a crime together, make him wear the hat.

1385
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,000
- You'll be OK for 20 minutes?
- Yes, yes.

1386
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,640
- Sorry, I...I wasn't thinking of Rosie.
- No problem.

1387
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,280
I should, er, come and see her soon.

1388
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,520
- Yes.
- Actually, he should wear the hat as a special tribute to me.

1389
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,000
I'm dead, I would really appreciate it.

1390
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,160
Oh, by the way, the recordings will probably be inadmissible.

1391
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:57,200
- Sorry, what?
- Well, technically, it's entrapment,

1392
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,080
so it might get thrown out as evidence.

1393
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:02,040
Not that that matters. Apparently he can't stop confessing.

1394
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,680
- That's good.
- Yeah.

1395
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,680
Are you OK? JOHN LAUGHS

1396
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,360
What, am I...? No, no, I'm not OK.

1397
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:16,160
I'm never going to be OK.

1398
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,400
And we'll just have to accept that.

1399
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,680
It is what it is,

1400
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:22,280
and what it is is...shit.

1401
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:23,320
John, do better.

1402
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:30,240
You didn't kill Mary. Mary died saving your life.

1403
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,160
It was her choice, no-one made her do it.

1404
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:33,800
No-one could ever make her do anything.

1405
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,920
The point is, you did not kill her.

1406
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,120
In saving my life, she conferred a value on it.

1407
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,760
It is a currency I do not know how to spend.

1408
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,720
It is what it is.

1409
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,760
I'm tomorrow, six till ten. I'll see you then.

1410
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,400
- Looking forward to it.
- Yeah.

1411
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,200
WOMAN GROANS

1412
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,000
That noise, that's a text alert noise?

1413
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,160
What was that?

1414
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,400
Hmm? What was what?

1415
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,200
That's the text alert of Irene Adler.

1416
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:14,760
She's the scary mad one, right?

1417
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:17,360
- That noise?
- What noise?

1418
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,640
But she's dead.

1419
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,440
- SHE GASPS
- Ooh, I bet she isn't dead!

1420
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,360
I bet he saved her.

1421
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,120
Oh, my God!

1422
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,840
Oh, the posh boy loves the dominatrix.

1423
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,520
He's never knowingly under-cliched, is he?

1424
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,360
John?

1425
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:35,120
- I'm going to make a deduction.
- Oh, OK, that's good.

1426
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,600
And if my deduction is right,

1427
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:39,640
- you're going to be honest and tell me, OK?
- OK.

1428
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:42,440
Though I should mention that it is possible for any given text alert

1429
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:45,400
- to become randomly attached to...
- Happy birthday.

1430
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:51,640
Thank you, John, that's...very kind of you.

1431
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,640
Never knew when your birthday was.

1432
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,520
Well, now you do.

1433
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:58,640
- Seriously, we're not going to talk about this?
- Talk about what?

1434
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,720
- I mean, how does it work?
- How does what work?

1435
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:02,080
You and The Woman.

1436
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,040
Do you go to a discreet Harvester sometimes?

1437
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,960
Is there nights of passion in High Wycombe?

1438
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:09,880
Oh, for God's sakes, I don't text her back!

1439
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,320
- LAUGHS:
- Why not?

1440
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:13,800
You bloody moron!

1441
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:17,640
She's out there, she likes you and she's alive!

1442
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,560
And do you have the first idea

1443
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:20,920
how lucky you are?!

1444
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:25,120
Yes, she's a lunatic, she's a criminal, she's insanely dangerous.

1445
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,800
- Trust you to fall for a sociopath!
- Oh, married an assassin!

1446
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,240
But she's, you know...

1447
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,240
- What?
- Just text her back.
- Why?

1448
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:34,960
Because High Wycombe is better than

1449
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,680
you are currently equipped to understand!

1450
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,920
I once caught a triple poisoner in High Wycombe.

1451
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,720
That's only the beginning, mate.

1452
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:44,200
As I think I have explained to you many times before,

1453
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:47,000
romantic entanglement, while fulfilling for other people...

1454
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,720
- Would complete you as a human being.
- That doesn't even mean anything.

1455
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:50,920
Just text her, phone her,

1456
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,680
do something while there's still a chance,

1457
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:54,440
because that chance doesn't last forever.

1458
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,720
Trust me, Sherlock, it's gone before you know it.

1459
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,280
Before you know it!

1460
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:07,000
She was wrong about me.

1461
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,040
Mary? How so?

1462
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,680
She thought that if you put yourself in harm's way,

1463
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:15,680
I'd...I'd rescue you, or something.

1464
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,840
But I didn't, not till she told me to.

1465
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:21,360
And that's how this works, that's what you're missing.

1466
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,880
She taught me to be the man she already thought I was.

1467
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,240
Get yourself a piece of that.

1468
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:27,360
Forgive me, but you are doing yourself a disservice.

1469
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,840
I have known many people in this world, but made few friends,

1470
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,920
- and I can safely say...
- I cheated on her.

1471
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,680
No clever comeback?

1472
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:38,000
I cheated on you, Mary.

1473
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,240
There was a woman on the bus,

1474
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,240
and I had a plastic daisy in my hair,

1475
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:45,720
I'd been playing with Rosie.

1476
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,120
And this girl just smiled at me.

1477
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,400
That's all it was, it was a smile.

1478
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,480
We texted, constantly.

1479
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,640
You want to know when?

1480
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,680
Every time you left the room - that's when.

1481
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,480
When you were feeding our daughter.

1482
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:04,320
When you were stopping her from crying - that's when.

1483
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:10,040
And that's all it was.

1484
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,640
Just texting.

1485
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,040
But I wanted more.

1486
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:19,360
And do you know something? I still do.

1487
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,200
I'm not the man you thought I was, I'm not that guy.

1488
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,720
I never could be.

1489
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,040
But that's the point.

1490
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,720
- VOICE BREAKS:
- That's the whole point.

1491
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:37,200
Who you thought I was...

1492
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,040
..is the man who I want to be.

1493
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:45,520
Well, then...

1494
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:49,160
..John Watson...

1495
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:56,920
..get the hell on with it.

1496
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:09,600
JOHN SOBS

1497
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:17,960
- It's OK.
- It's not OK.

1498
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,120
No...

1499
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:24,640
..but it is what it is.

1500
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,880
So, Molly's going to meet us at this cake place.

1501
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:38,400
Well, it's your birthday. Cake is obligatory.

1502
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,640
Oh, well, I suppose a sugar high is some sort of substitute.

1503
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,040
Behave.

1504
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,880
Right then. You know, it's not my place to say,

1505
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:48,760
but...it was just texting.

1506
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:55,160
- People text. Even
- I
- text. Her, I mean. Woman. Bad idea.

1507
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:57,240
Try not to, but, you know, sometimes...

1508
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,640
It's not a pleasant thought, John,

1509
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,960
but I have this terrible feeling from time to time

1510
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:05,360
that we might all just be human.

1511
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,080
- Even you?
- No.

1512
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:09,560
Even you.

1513
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,800
- Cake?
- Cake! Oh, um...

1514
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,960
What? What is it?

1515
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,000
What's wrong?

1516
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:24,120
- JOHN LAUGHS
- Seriously?

1517
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:25,920
I'm Sherlock Holmes - I wear the damn hat!

1518
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,400
Isn't that right, Mary?

1519
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:43,360
You seem so much better, John.

1520
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:46,520
Yeah, I...I am. I think I am.

1521
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:50,040
Not all day, not every day, but, you know.

1522
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:52,040
- It is what it is?
- Yeah.

1523
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,280
And Rosie?

1524
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,760
Beautiful, perfect.

1525
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:00,040
Unprecedented in the history of children.

1526
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,920
That's not my bias - that's scientific fact.

1527
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:05,800
- Good. And Sherlock Holmes?
- Back to normal.

1528
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:06,960
'Get out!'

1529
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,280
She's possessed by the devil!

1530
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:10,280
I swear, my wife is channelling Satan!

1531
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:12,000
Yes, boring, go away!

1532
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,840
I'm not channelling Satan!

1533
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,960
Why not, given your immediately alternative?

1534
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:27,680
- What about his brother?
- Mycroft? He's fine.

1535
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:31,480
So, you're off now. I won't see you for a week?

1536
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:35,720
- Just spending it at home. Unless she calls.
- The PM.

1537
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,720
- Here.
- What's this?

1538
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:42,280
- My number.
- I already have your number.

1539
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:45,000
- My private number.
- Why would I need that?

1540
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,440
I don't know. Maybe you'd like a drink sometime.

1541
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:52,440
- Of...what?
- Up to you.

1542
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,120
Call me.

1543
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:00,000
HE CHUCKLES

1544
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:08,360
I mean, obviously, "normal" and "fine"

1545
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:11,040
are both relative terms when it comes to Sherlock and Mycroft.

1546
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,880
Obviously.

1547
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,040
She was real.

1548
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,040
'But I didn't mean Mycroft.'

1549
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:34,240
I meant the other one.

1550
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:37,160
- Which other one?
- You know, the secret one.

1551
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:39,880
Oh, that was just something I said.

1552
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,040
I'm sure there's...

1553
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,400
How did you know about that? I didn't tell you that.

1554
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:49,560
- You must have done.
- I really didn't.

1555
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:52,280
Well, maybe Sherlock told me.

1556
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:56,280
But you've met Sherlock exactly once, in this room,

1557
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:57,600
he was off his head.

1558
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,520
Oh, no, no, I met him before that.

1559
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:01,840
When?

1560
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:05,760
We spent a night together. It was lovely.

1561
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,560
We had chips.

1562
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:16,240
- IN NORTHERN ACCENT:
- "You're not what I expected, Mr Holmes."

1563
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:20,880
"You're...nicer."

1564
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:35,920
Culverton gave me Faith's original note.

1565
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,320
A mutual friend put us in touch.

1566
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:42,880
Did Sherlock ever tell you about the note?

1567
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:45,560
I added some deductions for Sherlock.

1568
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:47,880
He was quite good.

1569
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:52,640
But...he didn't get the big one.

1570
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:09,040
In fairness, though, he does have excellent taste in chips.

1571
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,600
- What's that?
- What's what?

1572
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,600
The flower in your hair, it's like I had on the bus.

1573
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:15,200
You looked very sweet.

1574
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,440
But then...

1575
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:21,880
.."You have such nice eyes."

1576
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:25,200
Amazing the times a man doesn't really look at your face.

1577
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:29,640
Oh, you can hide behind a sexy smile or a walking cane,

1578
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:31,760
or just be a therapist,

1579
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:36,280
talking about you...ALL the time.

1580
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:37,800
Oh, please don't go anywhere,

1581
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:39,800
I'm sure the therapist who actually lives here

1582
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,320
wouldn't want blood on the carpet.

1583
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,360
Oh, hang on, it's fine.

1584
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,120
She's in a sack in the airing cupboard.

1585
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,320
- Who are you?
- Isn't it obvious?

1586
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,520
Haven't you guessed?

1587
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:52,920
I'm Eurus.

1588
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:54,360
Eurus?

1589
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:58,960
Silly name, isn't it? Greek. Means "the east wind".

1590
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,200
My parents loved silly names,

1591
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,720
like Eurus...

1592
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,960
or Mycroft...

1593
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:08,480
or Sherlock.

1594
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:09,800
Oh, look at him.

1595
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,960
Didn't it ever occur to you, not even once,

1596
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:16,040
that Sherlock's secret brother might just be Sherlock's secret sister?

1597
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:18,920
Huh?

1598
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,680
He's making a funny face.

1599
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,360
I think I'll put a hole in it.
