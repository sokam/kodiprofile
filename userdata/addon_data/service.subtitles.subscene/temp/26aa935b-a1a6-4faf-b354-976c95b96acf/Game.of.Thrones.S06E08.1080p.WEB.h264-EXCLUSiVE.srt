Lady Crane:
<i>My son.</i>

00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:55,179
My firstborn son.

5
00:01:58,413 --> 00:02:01,836
My child king, hush.

6
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:06,699
Listen to the gods,
for you they sing.

7
00:02:10,573 --> 00:02:12,171
Fight no more, sweet child.

8
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:14,220
Your wars are won.

9
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,060
The wolves are buried

10
00:02:18,158 --> 00:02:20,363
and the false stag done.

11
00:02:24,557 --> 00:02:26,667
Shut your blue eyes, my love.

12
00:02:26,765 --> 00:02:28,235
Let the crown fall.

13
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,827
The Father above
beckons you to his hall.

14

In Seventh Heaven
I'll see you once more.

15
00:02:39,149 --> 00:02:43,595
But now I seek vengeance
on Sansa the whore

16
00:02:43,693 --> 00:02:46,315
and my brother the Imp

17
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:49,099
who killed his own king.

18
00:02:49,197 --> 00:02:51,756
Born amongst lions,
our curse from within.

19
00:02:51,853 --> 00:02:54,028
I will slay him, I swear.

20

I'm a jealous woman.

42

I've always liked bad men

43
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:37,707
and they've always liked me.

44
00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:42,091
They'd come home wherever
home was that night

00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:46,219
stinking of some whore's perfume.

46
00:04:46,317 --> 00:04:49,036
So we'd fight and I'd
put a hole in them.

47
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:51,755
And then I'd feel terrible,

48
00:04:51,853 --> 00:04:53,739
so I'd patch them up.

49
00:04:53,838 --> 00:04:55,179
<i>I got good at patching them up.</i>

50
00:04:55,277 --> 00:04:56,843
And good at putting holes in them.

51
00:04:56,941 --> 00:04:59,084
(chuckles) And that.

52
00:05:01,805 --> 00:05:03,947
What happened to the actress?

53
00:05:04,045 --> 00:05:07,020
<i>The one who wanted you dead.</i>

54
00:05:07,117 --> 00:05:08,684
Bianca.

55
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:11,212
She'll have a hard time
finding work as an actress

56
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:13,259
after what I did to her face.

57

58
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:19,435

59
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:21,515
I never did learn to cook.

60
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,075
But eat.
Eat. You need it.

61
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,843
The company is moving
on to Pentos soon.

62
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:30,412
You should come with us.

63
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:32,459
- I can't.
- Why not?

64
00:05:32,557 --> 00:05:34,891
Got a feeling you'd be
good at this sort of work.

65
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:36,971
And besides, we need a new actress.

66
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:40,651
I don't think I could
remember all of the lines.

67
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:43,051
Come with us.

68
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:45,035
What's left for you here?

69
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:48,811
You wouldn't be safe.

70
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:51,595
Not while she's looking for me.

71
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:53,739
<i>Who?</i>

72
00:05:53,837 --> 00:05:55,339
She doesn't have a name.

73
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:02,283
Where will you go?

74
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:08,395
Essos is east and Westeros is west.

75
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,380
But what's west of Westeros?

76
00:06:11,725 --> 00:06:12,747
I don't know.

77
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:14,347
Nobody does.

78
00:06:14,445 --> 00:06:16,459
<i>That's where all the maps stop.</i>

79
00:06:16,557 --> 00:06:18,411
The edge of the world, maybe.

80

<i>I'd like to see that.</i>

- Milk of the poppy.

83
00:06:32,397 --> 00:06:33,899
I don't want any.

84
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:38,987
Sleep is the only way you'll heal.

85

Thing about Gatins, right,
is he used to be pretty.

89
00:07:26,701 --> 00:07:27,979
I was a famous kisser.

90
00:07:28,077 --> 00:07:30,539

91
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,579
Course we do.

92
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:36,107
This is for masters, this technique.

93
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,963
- You're not ready.
- I'm ready.

94
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:40,363
He says he's ready.

95
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:43,339
All right.
Now, pay attention.

96
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:49,195
You put your left hand on the
back of the lady's head.

97
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:52,459
Your right hand holds the small
of the lady's back like so.

98
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:54,859
Very romantic.

99
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:57,835
Take your middle finger, yeah,

100
00:07:57,933 --> 00:07:59,947
and you jam it right up her bunghole.

Ah, it smells like pussy to me.

It is a request, Cousin Lancel.

You are asking me for
something, I'm refusing.

165
00:11:51,565 --> 00:11:54,570
The High Septon commands you.

166
00:11:54,669 --> 00:11:56,683
<i>Are you sure you want to refuse him?</i>

167
00:11:58,924 --> 00:12:01,867
He promised me I could stay in
the Red Keep until my trial.

168
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:03,818
He made no such promises.

169
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:05,857
If you refuse to come of your
own free will...

170
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:07,047
Get out.

171
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,995
Move aside, ser.

172
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:21,035
(raspy breathing)

173
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:23,947
Order your man to step aside
or there will be violence.

174
00:12:31,245 --> 00:12:32,843
I choose violence.

175
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,106
(grunts)

176
00:12:38,988 --> 00:12:40,458
(grunts)

177
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:47,659
(gasping)

178
00:12:52,236 --> 00:12:53,579
(gasping)

179
00:13:12,365 --> 00:13:15,755
Please tell His High Holiness
he's always welcome to visit.

180
00:13:20,876 --> 00:13:22,442
(men shouting)

181
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:29,035
Looks like a siege, my lady.

182
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:32,363
You have a keen military mind, Pod.

183
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:43,723
My lady.
My lady.

184
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:49,195
Who goes there?!

185
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:50,475
State your business!

186
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:52,523
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

187
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,298
Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister
I've come to speak with him.

188
00:13:58,157 --> 00:14:01,003
Tell him I have his sword.

189
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,307
<i>(men shouting)</i>

190
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:10,219
(grunting)

191
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,899
Getting a bit old
to be a squire, aren't we?

192
00:14:15,692 --> 00:14:16,779
(coughing)

193
00:14:16,877 --> 00:14:19,019
(laughs)

194
00:14:19,117 --> 00:14:20,331
Podrick fucking Payne.

195
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:22,922
I thought you'd be dead by now.

196
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,363
Not yet.

197
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:25,898
(laughs)

198
00:14:25,997 --> 00:14:27,978
- Are they in there?
- Uh-huh.

199
00:14:31,693 --> 00:14:33,707
You think they're fucking?

200
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:35,275
What?

201
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:36,907
No.

202
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:39,754
Why not?
I'd fuck her.

203
00:14:39,852 --> 00:14:41,418
You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?

204
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:43,723
- I'm her squire.
- Oh.

205
00:14:43,821 --> 00:14:46,891
(chuckles) Well, he'd
fuck her, that's for sure.

206
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:48,875
And she'd fuck him, don't you think?

207
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:50,731
The way she looks at him.

208
00:14:50,828 --> 00:14:53,227
The way all women look at
him is frankly irritating.

209
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:56,299
I preferred working with the
little brother on that account.

210
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:59,979
Come on, you're the one
with the magic cock.

211
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:03,338
You must have shown it to her by now.

212
00:15:05,293 --> 00:15:07,882
- She's training me to fight.
- Is she?

213
00:15:07,981 --> 00:15:10,314
Oh. - An hour in the morning,
an hour at night.

214
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:12,138
Every day.

215
00:15:12,236 --> 00:15:15,882
Then how come an old cunt like me
can still sneak up and murder you?

216
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,410
Well, that's a different
sort of fighting.

217
00:15:18,508 --> 00:15:20,043
Now, that's the truth, isn't it?

218
00:15:20,141 --> 00:15:22,602
<i>You want to learn</i>
<i>that sort of fighting?</i>

219
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,674
All right.

220
00:15:25,772 --> 00:15:27,946
All right, let's start
with your footwork.

221
00:15:28,044 --> 00:15:30,155
Show me your stance.

222
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:33,035
Now listen to me, Pod.

223
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,690
See how your feet
are about a yard apart?

224
00:15:35,788 --> 00:15:38,475
Lesson number one, assume
everyone wants to hit you.

225
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:42,506
'Cause they do, Pod. Everyone
wants to hit a fucking squire.

226
00:15:42,604 --> 00:15:45,099
Do it again.
Come on, don't sulk.

227
00:15:45,196 --> 00:15:46,731
<i>Jaime: I never thought</i>
<i>you'd find her.</i>

228
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:48,202
<i>I just assumed Sansa was dead.</i>

229
00:15:48,301 --> 00:15:50,315
Why would you assume that?

230
00:15:50,413 --> 00:15:54,186
In my experience, girls like
her don't live very long.

231
00:15:54,284 --> 00:15:56,810
I don't think you know
many girls like her.

232
00:15:56,908 --> 00:15:59,722
Well, I'm proud of you.

233
00:15:59,821 --> 00:16:02,314
<i>I am. You fulfilled your</i>
<i>oath to Catelyn Stark</i>

234
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:04,107
<i>against all odds.</i>

235
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:07,050
Of course, my sister
wants Sansa dead.

236
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:09,642
The girl is still a suspect
in Joffrey's murder,

237
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,322
so there is that complication.

238
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:16,287
What the hell are you doing here?

239
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,995
I've come for the Blackfish.

240
00:16:18,092 --> 00:16:19,819
You're welcome to have him.

241
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:23,530
Lady Sansa desires to take her
ancestral seat back from the Boltons

242
00:16:23,628 --> 00:16:26,666
and assume her rightful
position as Lady of Winterfell.

243
00:16:26,764 --> 00:16:29,706
With what army does she
plan on taking Winterfell?

244
00:16:29,804 --> 00:16:31,114
The Tully army.

245
00:16:31,212 --> 00:16:32,874
They're a bit occupied at the moment.

246
00:16:32,972 --> 00:16:34,571
I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun

247
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:36,331
currently defended
by the Tully rebels,

248
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,059
so you can see the conundrum.

249
00:16:38,157 --> 00:16:40,171
The Tullys are rebels because
they're fighting for their home?

250
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:42,603
Riverrun was granted to
the Freys by royal decree.

251
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,058
As a reward for betraying Robb
Stark and slaughtering his family.

252
00:16:46,157 --> 00:16:47,499
Exactly.

253
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:52,907
We shouldn't argue about politics.

254
00:16:53,004 --> 00:16:55,626
You're a knight, Ser Jaime.

255
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,611
I know there is honor in you.

256
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,362
- I've seen it myself.
- I'm a Lannister.

257
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,282
Don't ask me to betray my own house.

258
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,554
I do no such thing.

259
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:07,115
Take Riverrun without bloodshed.

260
00:17:07,213 --> 00:17:10,603
Ride south again with your mission
complete and your army intact.

261
00:17:10,701 --> 00:17:12,234
What do you propose?

262
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:15,851
Allow me to enter Riverrun
under a flag of truce.

263
00:17:15,948 --> 00:17:18,268
Let me try to persuade the
Blackfish to give up the castle.

264
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:20,203
Why would he abandon
his ancestral home?

265
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:23,754
Because you'll allow him to lead
the Tully forces safely north.

266
00:17:26,636 --> 00:17:28,427
Have you ever met the Blackfish?

267
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:33,131
- No.
- He's even more stubborn than you are.

268
00:17:33,228 --> 00:17:35,211
All right.

269
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:37,610
Try to talk some sense
into the old goat.

270
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,915
He won't listen, but his men might.

271
00:17:40,013 --> 00:17:42,379
Not everybody wants to die
for someone else's home.

272
00:17:42,476 --> 00:17:44,426
I need your word.

273
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,531
If I persuade him
to abandon the castle,

274
00:17:47,628 --> 00:17:49,963
you'll grant a safe passage north.

275
00:17:50,061 --> 00:17:52,170
You have my word.

276
00:17:52,268 --> 00:17:54,122
You have until nightfall.

277
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,250
(sighs)

278
00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:12,907
You gave it to me for a purpose.

279
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:16,075
I've achieved that purpose.

280
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,362
It's yours.

281
00:18:22,028 --> 00:18:23,946
It will always be yours.

282
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:34,794
One last thing, Ser Jaime.

283
00:18:34,892 --> 00:18:36,938
Yes, Lady Brienne?

284
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:40,810
Should I fail to persuade
the Blackfish to surrender

285
00:18:40,908 --> 00:18:43,658
and if you attack the castle,

286
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:46,666
honor compels me
to fight for Sansa's kin.

287
00:18:46,764 --> 00:18:48,746
Of course it does.

288
00:18:48,844 --> 00:18:50,283
To fight you.

289
00:18:54,604 --> 00:18:56,682
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

290
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:08,458
<i>Blackfish: I've said no</i>
<i>three times already.</i>

291
00:19:08,556 --> 00:19:10,699
I have a signed letter
from your niece Sansa Stark.

292
00:19:10,796 --> 00:19:12,523
I haven't seen her
since she was a child.

293
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,699
I don't know her signature.
I don't know you.

294
00:19:14,797 --> 00:19:18,123
And I will not surrender.
Double the guards tonight.

295
00:19:19,468 --> 00:19:21,611
The Kingslayer wants to try us.

296
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,562
I can feel it.

297
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,122
As I have said, my name is...

298
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:28,554
Yes, Brienne of Tarth.
I know your father.

299
00:19:28,652 --> 00:19:30,378
- Good man.
- He always spoke highly of you.

300
00:19:30,476 --> 00:19:33,066
And if he were here now, I'd tell
him the same I'm telling you.

301
00:19:33,164 --> 00:19:35,498
If you think I'm abandoning
my family's seat

302
00:19:35,596 --> 00:19:37,802
on the Kingslayer's word of
honor, you're a bloody fool.

303
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,459
Riverrun cannot stand against
the Lannisters and the Freys.

304
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:44,010
We can stand longer than your
one-handed friend thinks we can.

305
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:46,442
- He's not my friend.
- No?

306
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,986
Who gave you permission to cross the
siege line and enter the castle?

307
00:19:51,084 --> 00:19:53,738
Who gave you that sword with
the gold lion on the pommel?

308
00:19:53,836 --> 00:19:57,482
Ser Jaime kept his word
to your niece Catelyn Stark.

309
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,682
He sent me to find Sansa,
to help her as Catelyn wanted.

310
00:20:00,781 --> 00:20:02,795
He gave me this sword to protect her.

311
00:20:02,892 --> 00:20:05,450
That is what I have done
and I will continue to do

312
00:20:05,548 --> 00:20:07,755
until the day I die.

313
00:20:17,612 --> 00:20:20,266
(chuckles)

314
00:20:20,364 --> 00:20:22,603
She's exactly like her mother.

315
00:20:28,652 --> 00:20:31,562
I don't have enough men to
help her take Winterfell.

316
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,642
You have more than she does.

317
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,170
She wants her home back.
I understand that.

318
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,058
But this is my home.

319
00:20:38,156 --> 00:20:40,042
And if Jaime Lannister wants it,

320
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:43,594
he can bloody well take it
the way everyone else does.

321
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,250
Find the maester.

322
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:04,938
We need to get a raven
north to Sansa.

323
00:21:06,636 --> 00:21:08,298
What should I write?

324
00:21:10,988 --> 00:21:12,779
Tell her I failed.

325
00:21:14,604 --> 00:21:16,522
(chatter)

326
00:21:42,348 --> 00:21:43,882
There's to be a royal announcement?

327
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,866
There is.

328
00:21:45,964 --> 00:21:47,498
Why wasn't I informed?

329
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:52,362
There is to be a royal announcement

330
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,346
in the throne room

331
00:21:54,444 --> 00:21:56,362
at this very moment.

332
00:21:59,244 --> 00:22:01,194
Where are you going?

333
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,962
To stand by my son.

334
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,618
Your place is in the gallery

335
00:22:08,717 --> 00:22:11,274
with the other ladies of the court.

336
00:22:18,668 --> 00:22:20,235
Pycelle:
<i>Your Grace...</i>

337
00:22:37,517 --> 00:22:39,754
Tommen:
<i>Lords and ladies,</i>

338
00:22:39,852 --> 00:22:42,378
the Faith and the Crown

339
00:22:42,476 --> 00:22:45,578
are the two pillars
that hold up this world.

340
00:22:45,676 --> 00:22:49,162
One collapses, so does the other.

341
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:53,066
The Father judges us all.

342
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:54,539
If you break his laws...

343
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,466
<i>you will be punished.</i>

344
00:23:01,164 --> 00:23:04,810
After conferring with His
Holiness the High Septon,

345
00:23:04,908 --> 00:23:07,146
we have determined that Loras Tyrell

346
00:23:07,244 --> 00:23:08,874
and Cersei Lannister's trial

347
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,954
<i>will be held in</i>
<i>the Great Sept of Baelor</i>

348
00:23:11,052 --> 00:23:13,450
<i>on the first day of the</i>
<i>Festival of the Mother.</i>

349
00:23:13,548 --> 00:23:16,202
(crowd murmuring)

350
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,442
Furthermore, after much prayer

351
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,522
<i>and reflection,</i>

352
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,594
the Crown has decided
that from this day forward,

353
00:23:27,692 --> 00:23:29,578
trial by combat will be forbidden

354
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:31,627
throughout the Seven Kingdoms.

355
00:23:31,724 --> 00:23:33,290
<i>(crowd murmuring)</i>

356
00:23:33,388 --> 00:23:35,498
<i>Tommen: The tradition</i>
<i>is a brutish one,</i>

357
00:23:35,596 --> 00:23:37,482
<i>a scheme devised by corrupt rulers</i>

358
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,106
<i>in order to avoid</i>
<i>true judgment from the gods.</i>

359
00:23:40,204 --> 00:23:42,602
<i>Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell</i>

360
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,586
will stand trial before seven septons

361
00:23:44,684 --> 00:23:47,370
as it was in the earliest
days of the Faith.

362
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,515
<i>Seven blessings to all.</i>

363
00:23:49,612 --> 00:23:51,402
Crowd:
<i>Seven blessings.</i>

364
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:01,035
<i>(doors open)</i>

365
00:24:12,876 --> 00:24:15,242
Your Grace...

366
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,666
that old rumor you told me about.

367
00:24:20,236 --> 00:24:22,506
My little birds investigated.

368
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,922
And?

369
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,994
Was it just a rumor
or something more?

370
00:24:30,092 --> 00:24:31,658
More.

371
00:24:33,804 --> 00:24:35,338
Much more.

372
00:24:41,068 --> 00:24:43,178
Missandei:
<i>You seem happy.</i>

373
00:24:43,276 --> 00:24:45,034
I am happy.

374
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,978
You should both be happy as well.

375
00:24:48,076 --> 00:24:52,266
Not so long ago, this city
was ready to devour itself.

376
00:24:52,364 --> 00:24:54,698
Now it's like a man reborn.

377
00:24:54,796 --> 00:24:56,810
I will be happy
when our queen returns.

378
00:24:56,908 --> 00:25:00,426
Why don't you drink? Why don't
either of you ever drink?

379
00:25:00,524 --> 00:25:01,802
Unsullied never drink.

380
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,114
- Why not?
- Rules.

381
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:05,418
And who made these rules?

382
00:25:05,516 --> 00:25:07,338
Your former masters?

383
00:25:07,436 --> 00:25:10,378
<i>Those miserable old shits</i>
<i>didn't want you to be human.</i>

384
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:12,458
Have a drink with me.

385
00:25:15,308 --> 00:25:18,442
And you?
What's your excuse?

386
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:20,874
I have tried wine before.

387
00:25:20,971 --> 00:25:22,698
It made me feel funny.

388
00:25:22,796 --> 00:25:24,682
That's how you know it's working.

389
00:25:27,052 --> 00:25:29,450
Here's to our queen.

390
00:25:29,548 --> 00:25:32,682
Anyone not drinking
is disrespecting our queen.

391
00:25:35,788 --> 00:25:37,898
To Daenerys Stormborn,
Mother of Dragons,

392
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:40,586
Breaker of Chains,
long may she reign.

393
00:25:40,684 --> 00:25:42,794
- Long may she reign.
- Long may she reign.

394
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,770
Tyrion:
<i>Do you like it?</i>

395
00:25:49,868 --> 00:25:51,818
Tastes like it has turned.

396
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:55,018
Yes, yes.
Fermentation.

397
00:25:58,444 --> 00:26:02,858
One day, after our queen has
taken the Seven Kingdoms...

398
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:06,666
I'd like to have my own vineyard.

399
00:26:07,915 --> 00:26:10,442
Make my own wine.

400
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:12,938
The Imp's Delight.

401
00:26:13,036 --> 00:26:15,402
Only my close friends could drink it.

402
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,322
Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.

403
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,882
I do not know any jokes.

404
00:26:23,979 --> 00:26:25,066
Grey Worm?

405
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:29,194
Right.

406
00:26:30,988 --> 00:26:33,866
Three lords
walk into a tavern...

407
00:26:33,964 --> 00:26:36,362
a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.

408
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:37,898
<i>They order ale,</i>

409
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,394
but when the barkeep
brings them over,

410
00:26:40,492 --> 00:26:42,890
each of them finds a fly in his cup.

411
00:26:42,988 --> 00:26:47,146
The Lannister, outraged, shoves the
cup aside and demands another.

412
00:26:47,244 --> 00:26:51,242
The Martell plucks the fly
out and swallows it whole.

413
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:55,786
The Stark reaches into his cup,

414
00:26:55,884 --> 00:26:58,570
pulls out the fly and shouts,

415
00:26:58,668 --> 00:27:01,130
"Spit it out, you wee shit.

416
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:02,506
Spit it out."

417
00:27:08,076 --> 00:27:10,314
It's funnier in Westeros.

418
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:13,482
The Starks and the Lannisters,
I thought these were enemies.

419
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,570
Yes.

420
00:27:14,668 --> 00:27:18,154
A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho.

421
00:27:18,251 --> 00:27:20,298
Not a true story, necessarily.

422
00:27:20,396 --> 00:27:23,274
A story that's supposed
to make you laugh ideally.

423
00:27:23,372 --> 00:27:25,098
<i>Not at the moment, perhaps.</i>

424
00:27:25,196 --> 00:27:27,498
<i>Missandei, do you like the wine?</i>

425
00:27:27,595 --> 00:27:28,970
I do.

426
00:27:29,068 --> 00:27:30,346
Tell a joke.

427
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,857
Two translators
are on a sinking ship.

428
00:27:40,523 --> 00:27:42,410
The first says,

429
00:27:42,508 --> 00:27:44,778
"Do you know
how to swim?"

430
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:49,161
The second says, "No, but I can
shout for help in 19 languages."

431
00:27:52,076 --> 00:27:54,538
Ah!
(laughing)

432
00:27:57,868 --> 00:27:59,882
That is the worst joke I ever heard.

433
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:01,578
You don't even know what a joke is.

434
00:28:01,676 --> 00:28:04,458
I am soldier all my life.
You think I never hear joke?

435
00:28:04,556 --> 00:28:06,826
You lied to us.

436
00:28:08,332 --> 00:28:09,642
I make joke.

437
00:28:10,795 --> 00:28:12,554
(laughing)

438
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,130
More jokes.

439
00:28:21,228 --> 00:28:23,498
I once walked into a brothel

440
00:28:23,596 --> 00:28:25,162
with a honeycomb and a jackass.

441
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,817
- The madam says...
<i>- (Bells ringing)</i>

442
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,594
(Grey Worm shouting in Valyrian)

443
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,882
<i>(bells continue ringing)</i>

444
00:28:39,564 --> 00:28:42,121
The Masters have come
for their property.

445
00:28:51,275 --> 00:28:53,674
(men shouting)

446
00:28:59,468 --> 00:29:00,778
Lord Edmure.

447
00:29:02,572 --> 00:29:05,001
<i>I apologize for the way</i>
<i>the Freys treated you.</i>

448
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,274
A man of your birth deserves better.

449
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:11,177
You have my word you'll be properly
fed and clothed from now on.

450
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:14,986
I have your word?

451
00:29:15,084 --> 00:29:17,002
(scoffs)

452
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,401
Oh, good.

453
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,450
Good, that's...

454
00:29:21,548 --> 00:29:23,434
that's a fine thing.

455
00:29:25,132 --> 00:29:27,978
My uncle will never
surrender the castle, ser.

456
00:29:28,076 --> 00:29:29,961
Whatever game you're playing.

457
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,850
The Blackfish is an old man.

458
00:29:31,947 --> 00:29:33,961
A good death is all he can hope for.

459
00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:37,002
But you, you have a
child now, I've heard.

460
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,777
A son you sired
on your wedding night.

461
00:29:40,876 --> 00:29:42,601
You're a potent man.

462
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:44,938
A son I've never met

463
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:47,657
born of a wife that I haven't seen

464
00:29:47,755 --> 00:29:49,034
since our first night together.

465
00:29:49,132 --> 00:29:50,602
You should be with them both.

466
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:53,834
I can arrange that, you realize?

467
00:29:53,931 --> 00:29:55,881
Comfortable rooms for you
at Casterly Rock.

468
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,050
A tutor for your boy, knights to
train him to fight and to ride.

469
00:29:59,148 --> 00:30:01,482
And when he comes of age,
he'll have a keep of his own.

470
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,914
Do you imagine yourself
a decent person?

471
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:06,441
Is that it?

472
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,833
After you've massacred my family.

473
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,906
Kept me in a cell for years.

474
00:30:13,004 --> 00:30:14,889
Stolen our lands.

475
00:30:14,987 --> 00:30:17,450
I'll remind you that
our houses are at war.

476
00:30:17,548 --> 00:30:19,593
I'm sorry if this conflict
has inconvenienced you,

477
00:30:19,691 --> 00:30:22,090
but rebelling against the
Crown does have consequences.

478
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:24,336
Says the man who shoved his
sword through his king's back.

479
00:30:24,395 --> 00:30:27,082
Did I give you the impression
that this was a negotiation?

480
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:28,362
It's not.

481
00:30:30,763 --> 00:30:33,546
You understand. On some
level you understand

482
00:30:33,643 --> 00:30:35,497
that you're an evil man.

483
00:30:35,596 --> 00:30:37,161
I'll leave the judgments to the gods.

484
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,466
Well, that is convenient for you.

485
00:30:42,635 --> 00:30:46,090
You're a fine-looking
fellow, aren't you?

486
00:30:46,188 --> 00:30:48,489
<i>(chuckles)</i>

487
00:30:48,587 --> 00:30:51,050
Your square jaw,

488
00:30:51,148 --> 00:30:52,841
your golden armor.

489
00:30:54,443 --> 00:30:57,418
Tell me, I want to know.

490
00:30:57,516 --> 00:30:59,018
I truly do.

491
00:30:59,116 --> 00:31:00,521
How do you live with yourself?

492
00:31:04,107 --> 00:31:06,154
All of us have to believe

493
00:31:06,252 --> 00:31:09,130
that we're decent, don't we?

494
00:31:09,228 --> 00:31:12,266
You have to sleep at night.

495
00:31:12,364 --> 00:31:14,698
How do you tell yourself

496
00:31:14,796 --> 00:31:17,289
that you're decent

497
00:31:17,387 --> 00:31:19,786
after everything that you've done?

498
00:31:25,356 --> 00:31:27,626
I was your sister's prisoner once.

499
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:34,090
She hit me on the head with a
rock if I remember correctly.

500
00:31:34,188 --> 00:31:36,618
(laughs)

501
00:31:36,716 --> 00:31:38,474
Yeah.

502
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:41,354
She should have killed you.

503
00:31:41,451 --> 00:31:43,242
Perhaps, but she didn't.

504
00:31:44,587 --> 00:31:48,169
Catelyn Stark hated me
just like you hate me.

505
00:31:48,267 --> 00:31:50,441
<i>But I didn't hate her.</i>

506
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:52,041
I admired her.

507
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,929
Far more than her husband or her son.

508
00:31:54,027 --> 00:31:56,201
Do you think I care whom you
admire and whom you don't?

509
00:31:56,299 --> 00:31:58,831
No, I don't, but I'm telling you
anyway because you're my prisoner.

510
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,001
You don't have a choice.

511
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:03,017
The love she had for her children,

512
00:32:03,115 --> 00:32:05,002
I was a little awed by it.

513
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:07,369
Reminded me of my sister.

514
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,474
Oh.
Oh, I see.

515
00:32:12,236 --> 00:32:13,962
You're a madman.

516
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,849
I'm not here to trade insults.

517
00:32:15,947 --> 00:32:18,346
- Your sister was a strong...
- Don't talk about Cat!

518
00:32:18,443 --> 00:32:22,186
- I'll talk about whomever I want.
- (Grunts)

519
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:25,162
She loved her children.

520
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:27,721
I suppose all mothers do,

521
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:30,441
but Catelyn and Cersei,

522
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,521
there's a fierceness
you don't often see.

523
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:35,305
They'd do anything
to protect their babies.

524
00:32:35,403 --> 00:32:37,129
Start a war.

525
00:32:37,227 --> 00:32:40,842
Burn cities to ash.
Free their worst enemies.

526
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,018
The things we do for love.

527
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:50,794
You didn't come here
to talk about our sisters.

528
00:32:50,892 --> 00:32:53,674
That's exactly why I came here.

529
00:32:55,211 --> 00:32:57,289
I love Cersei.

530
00:32:57,387 --> 00:32:59,338
You can laugh at that if you want.

531
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:01,417
You can sneer.
Doesn't matter.

532
00:33:01,516 --> 00:33:03,305
She needs me.

533
00:33:03,403 --> 00:33:07,081
And to get back to her,
I have to take Riverrun.

534
00:33:10,379 --> 00:33:13,386
I'll send for your baby boy.

535
00:33:13,484 --> 00:33:16,618
And I'll launch him into
Riverrun with a catapult.

536
00:33:16,716 --> 00:33:19,882
Because you don't matter
to me, Lord Edmure.

537
00:33:19,979 --> 00:33:22,441
Your son doesn't matter to me.

538
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:26,058
The people in the castle
don't matter to me.

539
00:33:27,147 --> 00:33:29,161
Only Cersei.

540
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:33,130
And if I have to
slaughter every Tully

541
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:36,170
who ever lived to get back to her,

542
00:33:36,268 --> 00:33:38,665
that's what I'll do.

543
00:34:04,523 --> 00:34:06,986
Guard:
<i>Who goes there?</i>

544
00:34:07,084 --> 00:34:08,746
Edmure Tully,

545
00:34:08,843 --> 00:34:10,249
son of Hoster Tully

546
00:34:10,347 --> 00:34:12,617
and the rightful Lord of Riverrun.

547
00:34:14,924 --> 00:34:16,713
I demand entry.

548
00:34:16,811 --> 00:34:19,497
Don't let him in.

549
00:34:19,595 --> 00:34:21,865
He's the Lord of Riverrun.

550
00:34:21,963 --> 00:34:23,146
I have to obey his commands.

551
00:34:23,243 --> 00:34:24,778
He's been their captive

552
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:27,561
ever since they murdered
his king at the Red Wedding.

553
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:30,569
Why do you think the people who
murdered his king at the Red Wedding

554
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:33,801
would decide to let him come home?

555
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:36,937
Because it's a trap, you idiot.

556
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:38,281
Don't let him in.

557
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:40,009
He's my lord, my lord.

558
00:34:40,107 --> 00:34:42,762
I've sworn to serve the Lord of
Riverrun and obey his commands.

559
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,546
You're not obeying Edmure's commands.

560
00:34:45,644 --> 00:34:49,449
You're obeying the fucking
Kingslayer's commands.

561
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:52,106
Edmure:
<i>I demand entry.</i>

562
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:53,514
My lord has given an order.

563
00:34:53,611 --> 00:34:55,529
With a knife to his throat.

564
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:57,962
That is not a valid order.

565
00:35:02,507 --> 00:35:04,587
Lower the drawbridge and
open the gate for Lord Ed...

566
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,793
Man:
Aye, ser.

567
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:10,281
I'll have your head before
I surrender Riverrun.

568
00:35:10,379 --> 00:35:13,897
You are not lord
of this castle, my lord.

569
00:35:25,131 --> 00:35:27,882
- Lower the drawbridge.
<i>- Man ?2: Aye, ser!</i>

570
00:36:10,507 --> 00:36:12,105
Black Walder:
<i>If you're wrong,</i>

571
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:15,721
we've just surrendered
our most valuable prisoner.

572
00:36:54,027 --> 00:36:55,785
Welcome home, my lord.

573
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:03,434
Command all the forces within the
castle to lay down their arms.

574
00:37:05,483 --> 00:37:07,145
Open the gates.

575
00:37:07,243 --> 00:37:09,961
- My lord...
- Your lord has given a command.

576
00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:38,442
<i>(men shouting)</i>

577
00:37:42,571 --> 00:37:45,481
Man:
<i>Infantry, advance!</i>

578
00:37:58,091 --> 00:38:00,745
Find the Blackfish.

579
00:38:00,843 --> 00:38:03,945
Put him in irons and hand
him over to the Freys.

580
00:38:07,627 --> 00:38:09,385
Find him.

581
00:38:33,259 --> 00:38:35,273
Go on.

582
00:38:35,371 --> 00:38:36,554
Come with us.

583
00:38:36,651 --> 00:38:38,131
I've run before from the Red Wedding.

584
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:40,425
I'm not running again.
This is my family home.

585
00:38:40,523 --> 00:38:44,009
Your family is in the North.
Come with us.

586
00:38:44,107 --> 00:38:47,017
Don't die for pride when you
can fight for your blood.

587
00:38:48,587 --> 00:38:52,073
You'll serve Sansa far
better than I ever could.

588
00:38:57,003 --> 00:38:58,473
Guard:
<i>All the way down!</i>

589
00:38:58,571 --> 00:39:01,258
<i>- Check that out!</i>
- Go on, now.

590
00:39:01,355 --> 00:39:04,233
I haven't had a proper
sword fight in years.

591
00:39:04,331 --> 00:39:06,953
I expect I'll make
a damn fool of myself.

592
00:39:12,427 --> 00:39:14,153
<i>(men shouting)</i>

593
00:39:39,595 --> 00:39:42,217
We found the Blackfish, my lord.

594
00:39:42,315 --> 00:39:43,817
Good.

595
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:46,121
Bring him to me.

596
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:48,521
He died fighting, my lord.

597
00:40:48,682 --> 00:40:50,868
(men shouting)

598
00:41:15,051 --> 00:41:17,065
- I was wrong. I admit it.
- That changes nothing.

599
00:41:17,163 --> 00:41:19,465
The Unsullied could mount
a defense off the beachhead.

600
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:20,573
If the slavers' forces...

601
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:22,520
No more talking from you.
Your talking gave us this.

602
00:41:22,635 --> 00:41:24,208
And I have acknowledged that.
I'm trying...

603
00:41:24,235 --> 00:41:26,076
You're trying to tell me
what the army should do.

604
00:41:26,155 --> 00:41:28,489
<i>You do not know</i>
<i>what the army should do.</i>

605
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:30,665
All right, what should the army do?

606
00:41:30,763 --> 00:41:32,457
We'll not go to the beach.

607
00:41:32,555 --> 00:41:34,796
If we go to the beach, the
Masters will take the pyramid.

608
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,193
The pyramid is the only place
in the city we can defend.

609
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,665
- We stay here.
- And then?

610
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:40,489
We wait for them to come to us.

611
00:41:40,587 --> 00:41:42,697
Then we fight them.

612
00:41:42,795 --> 00:41:45,641
<i>(thudding, rattling)</i>

613
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:49,193
<i>(thumping)</i>

614
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:25,865
(dragon screeches)

615
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:31,017
<i>- (distant horse whinnies)</i>
<i>- (Men shouting)</i>

616
00:42:49,995 --> 00:42:51,625
Clegane.

617
00:42:51,723 --> 00:42:53,737
What the fuck you doing here?

618
00:42:53,835 --> 00:42:55,849
Chasing them.
You?

619
00:42:55,947 --> 00:42:57,705
Hanging them.

620
00:42:57,803 --> 00:42:59,433
Any particular reason?

621
00:42:59,531 --> 00:43:01,801
They're our men.
Or they were.

622
00:43:01,899 --> 00:43:04,361
They attacked a nearby sept
and murdered the villagers.

623
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:05,577
<i>Why do you want them?</i>

624
00:43:05,675 --> 00:43:07,113
Same reason.

625
00:43:07,211 --> 00:43:09,161
I was helping build it.

626
00:43:09,259 --> 00:43:11,401
<i>They killed a friend of mine.</i>

627
00:43:11,499 --> 00:43:12,713
You've got friends?

628
00:43:12,811 --> 00:43:15,560
Not anymore.
They're mine.

629
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:18,153
It's the Brotherhood's good name
they've dragged through the dirt.

630
00:43:18,187 --> 00:43:19,817
Fuck your name.
They're mine.

631
00:43:19,914 --> 00:43:21,394
I killed you once before, Dondarrion.

632
00:43:21,482 --> 00:43:23,369
Happy to do it again.

633
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:25,641
Drop that arrow, you bloody girl.

634
00:43:26,986 --> 00:43:29,321
Tougher girls than you
have tried to kill me.

635
00:43:31,499 --> 00:43:32,745
You can have one of them.

636
00:43:37,387 --> 00:43:38,697
Two.

637
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:51,881
No, no, no.

638
00:43:51,979 --> 00:43:54,345
We're not butchers.
We hang them.

639
00:43:54,443 --> 00:43:56,009
Hanging?

640
00:43:56,107 --> 00:43:57,448
All over in an instant.

641
00:43:57,547 --> 00:43:58,921
Where's the punishment in that?

642
00:43:59,018 --> 00:44:01,513
- They die.
- We all bloody die.

643
00:44:01,611 --> 00:44:03,977
Except this one here.

644
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:06,057
I'll only gut one of them.

645
00:44:06,155 --> 00:44:08,489
Beric:
<i>No.</i>

646
00:44:08,587 --> 00:44:10,280
I'll chop off one hand.

647
00:44:10,379 --> 00:44:13,321
We gave you two of the three
out of respect for your loss.

648
00:44:13,418 --> 00:44:14,761
That's generous.

649
00:44:18,379 --> 00:44:21,321
Bunch of nancies.

650
00:44:21,419 --> 00:44:23,817
There was a time I would
have killed all seven of you

651
00:44:23,915 --> 00:44:25,033
just to gut these three.

652
00:44:25,131 --> 00:44:26,377
You're getting old, Clegane.

653
00:44:26,475 --> 00:44:27,881
He's not.

654
00:44:27,978 --> 00:44:29,801
(gasping)

655
00:44:29,898 --> 00:44:32,329
Please don't.
I'll give you anything.

656
00:44:32,427 --> 00:44:35,113
(choking)

657
00:44:36,523 --> 00:44:38,601
(choking)

658
00:44:43,051 --> 00:44:45,513
(choking continues)

659
00:44:59,754 --> 00:45:01,545
Got anything to eat?

660
00:45:01,643 --> 00:45:04,200
<i>(distant horse whinnying)</i>

661
00:45:13,323 --> 00:45:15,401
Enjoying yourself?

662
00:45:15,499 --> 00:45:17,480
I prefer chicken.

663
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:22,057
You ought to join us.
We could use you.

664
00:45:23,306 --> 00:45:25,672
I tried joining.
Didn't work out for me.

665
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:28,585
Clegane, we're here for a reason.

666
00:45:30,091 --> 00:45:33,321
The Lord of Light is keeping
Beric alive for a reason.

667
00:45:33,419 --> 00:45:35,689
He gave a failed, drunk priest

668
00:45:35,786 --> 00:45:38,408
the power to bring him
back for a reason.

669
00:45:38,506 --> 00:45:40,745
We are part of something
larger than ourselves.

670
00:45:40,843 --> 00:45:43,881
Lots of horrible shit
in this world gets done

671
00:45:43,979 --> 00:45:45,961
for something larger than ourselves.

672
00:45:52,971 --> 00:45:55,849
Cold winds are rising in the North.

673
00:45:55,946 --> 00:45:58,153
And you're going to go stop them?

674
00:45:59,243 --> 00:46:00,713
We need good men to help us.

675
00:46:00,811 --> 00:46:04,424
Last time you saw me,
you wanted to execute me.

676
00:46:05,994 --> 00:46:07,529
Beric:
<i>True enough.</i>

677
00:46:07,627 --> 00:46:10,569
But the Lord of Light gave
you the power to defeat me.

678
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:13,064
- Why?
- (Laughs)

679
00:46:13,162 --> 00:46:15,944
I beat you because I'm
better than you, Beric.

680
00:46:16,042 --> 00:46:20,105
I was better than you before you
started yammering on about the Lord

681
00:46:20,202 --> 00:46:23,049
and I'm better than you now.

682
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:24,873
Aye, you're probably right.

683
00:46:24,971 --> 00:46:27,689
You're a fighter.

684
00:46:27,787 --> 00:46:29,929
You were born a fighter.

685
00:46:30,027 --> 00:46:32,329
You walked away from the fight.

686
00:46:32,426 --> 00:46:34,025
How did that go?

687
00:46:36,714 --> 00:46:39,848
Good and bad, young and old,

688
00:46:39,946 --> 00:46:42,601
the things we're fighting
will destroy them all alike.

689
00:46:44,363 --> 00:46:47,465
<i>You can still help a lot more</i>
<i>than you've harmed, Clegane.</i>

690
00:46:47,563 --> 00:46:49,385
It's not too late for you.

691
00:46:56,555 --> 00:46:58,473
<i>(footsteps approach)</i>

692
00:47:14,218 --> 00:47:16,201
(groans)

693
00:47:46,123 --> 00:47:48,520
<i>- (thuds)</i>
<i>- (Gasping)</i>

694
00:47:50,571 --> 00:47:52,296
Lady Crane?

695
00:47:54,091 --> 00:47:55,977
(winces)

696
00:48:00,203 --> 00:48:01,993
<i>Lady Crane?</i>

697
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:11,625
If you'd have done your job, she
would have died painlessly.

698
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:15,785
Instead...

699
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:20,136
The Many-Faced God
was promised a name.

700
00:48:21,483 --> 00:48:23,497
He must always receive what is his.

701
00:48:23,594 --> 00:48:26,185
You can't change that.

702
00:48:26,283 --> 00:48:28,617
I can't change that.

703
00:48:28,715 --> 00:48:30,665
No one can.

704
00:48:33,194 --> 00:48:35,560
And now he's been
promised another name.

705
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:43,496
(grunts)

706
00:48:50,474 --> 00:48:52,584

Hey!

00:50:17,803 --> 00:50:19,561
- Yah!
- (Man shouts)

713
00:50:20,587 --> 00:50:22,056
Ah!

714
00:50:22,155 --> 00:50:24,361

715
00:50:26,187 --> 00:50:28,617

Woman:
My basket!

00:50:36,907 --> 00:50:39,240

722
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:07,593
It will all be over soon.

723
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:11,656
On your knees or on your feet?

724
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:19,336
(groans)

725
00:52:21,962 --> 00:52:24,104
Haven't we been through this already?

726
00:52:26,187 --> 00:52:27,880
That won't help you.

727
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:38,600
You told her to kill me.

728
00:53:45,034 --> 00:53:46,600
Yes.

729
00:53:46,698 --> 00:53:49,064
<i>But here you are.</i>

730
00:53:49,162 --> 00:53:51,752
And there she is.

731
00:54:01,546 --> 00:54:04,296
Finally a girl is no one.

732
00:54:07,562 --> 00:54:10,920
A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell

733
00:54:11,018 --> 00:54:13,064
and I'm going home.
