description=Human Planet is an 8-part British television documentary series. It is produced by the BBC with co-production from Discovery and BBC Worldwide. It describes the human species and its relationship with the natural world by showing the remarkable ways humans have adapted to life in every environment on earth.

Announced in 2007, the production teams are based at the BBC Natural History Unit in Bristol and BBC Wales, and over two years, shooting over 70 stories in some of the most remote locations on earth spanning about 40 countries. Each episode of the series focuses on a different human-inhabited environment, including deserts, jungles, the Arctic, grasslands, rivers, mountains, oceans, and the urban landscape.

For the first time on a BBC landmark series the production has a dedicated stills photographer, Timothy Allen who is documenting the project photographically for the books that will accompany the series.

Human Planet is being broadcast in the UK on BBC One at 8pm on January 13th 2011 for 8 weeks, with an international release to follow soon after./description

A 1978 programme about the silicon chip predicted the decline of the Swiss watch industry.

Solid Steel is a weekly 2 hour radio mix show, now running for over 2 decades. Every week one of the regular contributors pairs up with a guest to mix and match 'the broadest beats'.

Matt Black and Jonathan More (aka Coldcut) started out on London's pirate KISS FM radio station with separate shows but then joined forces to present Solid Steel in 1988, a few years before the station finally went legal. In the early 90's they were joined on a regular basis by PC, shortly followed by Strictly Kev, for the two hour mix marathons. 

DK jumped on board in 1997, quickly rising to become producer and in 2000 the show enjoyed a spell on BBC London. In 2004 J Mountain joined the ranks and the show continued airing a diverse selection of guest mixes along with the occasional special interview. Solid Steel has spread it's wings, going on to broadcast in over 30 stations around the world, spawned a mix CD series and club nights. The podcast has already reached over a million downloads and new members Ruckus Roboticus, Cheeba, Boom Monk Ben and DJ Moneyshot step up in 2009 to expand the line up. Now we also enter a new phase with videocasts and other assorted AV projects, something that Coldcut have pioneered for nearly as long as the radio show./description

She released her first single "There You Go", on her first album, the R&B-oriented Can't Take Me Home, in 2000 via LaFace Records, which garnered commercial success. Her more pop rock-oriented second studio album, Missundaztood, which began a marked shift in the sound of her music, was released in 2001 and was a huge success worldwide.

Pink released her third album, Try This, in November 2003, which although less successful commercially than her previous release, still managed to sell around 3 million copies and earned her a Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the single "Trouble". Her fourth album, I'm Not Dead, was released in April 2006. The album generated several hit singles, including "Stupid Girls", "U + Ur Hand" and "Who Knew". Both "U + Ur Hand" and "Who Knew" went to #1 on the pop chart. Her fifth album, Funhouse, was released in late October 2008 and was preceded by her first solo number one on the Billboard Hot 100, "So What". The album notched three other Top 20 hits: "Sober", "Please Don't Leave Me" and "Glitter in the Air". On November 15, 2010, she released her first compilation, Greatest Hits... So Far!!!.

According to Billboard, Pink was rated #13 on the list of Artists of the Decade [1] and #1 Pop Song Artist of the Decade (2000ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃ¢ÂÂÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ÃÂÃÂÃ¢ÂÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃ¯Â¿Â½ÃÂÃÂ2009).[1] She has also scored ten Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 US hits, including eight as a solo artist, and has won two Grammy Awards, 5 MTV Video Music Awards and 2 Brit Awards. The People's Chart, announced through BBC Radio 1, declared Pink as the 11th Most Played Artist on UK Radio of the decade 2000 to 2009.[2] Pink has sold more than 30 million albums worldwide.[3] Forbes Magazine in 2010 named Pink the 27th most powerful celebrity, with $44 million earned between June 2009 and June 2010.[4]/description

description=Keeping Up Appearances is a BBC television sitcom created and written by Roy Clarke for the BBC, centred on the life of eccentric social climber Hyacinth Bucket, who insists that her surname is pronounced "Bouquet". The sitcom follows the obsessive and determined snobbish middle class woman of working class background -- a background she desperately seeks to hide, lest she revert if found out, as anyone English can never completely escape the class of one's birth. She desperately and continually looks for opportunities to climb the social ladder by attempting to impress people (particularly rich people) and portray herself as more affluent than she truly is, despite being wedged between a working class background and upper class aspirations. With running jokes and slapstick, she attempts to avoid association with her poorer relatives, counsels her unhappily married rich sister that status is more important than pleasure, refuses to admit her son is a lay-about and dandy, and that her neighbours do all they can to avoid her./description

description=This is a cut segment from a larger documentary on Time titled "BBC - Daytime"; It discusses some of the mysteries of memory and how time effects our lives.

Clive Wearing has a neurological disorder called Anterograde Amnesia which is a condition that doesn't allow new memories to transfer into long-term memory. This means that he will never remember anything since his incident, similarly to the movie Memento.

Clive was an accomplished pianist in the 80s', and fortunately can still play the piano flawlessly. He only remembers his wife, and anything else to him is new information, even if it was presented to him once before.

There's more information on Clive located here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Wearing and more information on anterograde amnesia here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterograde_amnesia/description

description=As in What is Reality? and To Infinity and Beyond, BBC is continuing to deal with the profound questions with a recent two-part series: Everything and Nothing.

In the first film Professor Al-Khalili tells the astonishing story of how we gazed upwards from our isolated and unremarkable vantage point and began to deduce the shape, size and origin of everything that there is. It's the story of how we came to understand reality at the largest scale. It's the story of everything./description
